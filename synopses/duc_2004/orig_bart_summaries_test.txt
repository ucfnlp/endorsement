Cambodian leader Hun Sen rejects opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country. He accuses them of trying to "internationalize" the political crisis. Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting. A series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party failed.

King Norodom Sihanouk declines requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's top political leaders. He says the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked negotiations to form a government. Cambodia's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on the monarch to lead top-level talks.

Cambodia's two-party opposition asks the Asian Development Bank to stop providing loans. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked. Opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its return an international issue.

Cambodia's ruling party responds to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. Congress. It defends Hun Sen's ouster of his co-prime minister as a proper response to the prince's attempts to negotiate defections. The killings of nearly 100 of Prince Norodom Ranariddh's supporters were dismissed by the CPP.

Cambodia's leading opposition party rules out sharing the presidency of Parliament with its arch foe. Disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks to form a new government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen has offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party. The prince's party says such a scenario is unconstitutional.

Hun Sen's party drops insistence on joint assembly chairmanship. The constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. The agreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they would be divided. The king, the sole force in Cambodian politics able to broker a deal, leaves Saturday.

Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh often clashed over power-sharing. Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen ousted the prince in a coup. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a coalition deal. The parties are to form working groups this week to divide remaining government posts.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom of all politicians. The assurances were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party. He was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices in September to avoid arrest.

Opposition leader Sam Rainsy seeks clarification of security guarantees promised by Hun Sen. Hun Sen announced a government guarantee of all politicians' safety Wednesday. The opposition leader was forced to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest. The two parties have formed three working groups to hammer out details of the agreement.

King Norodom Sihanouk praises agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties. They agreed to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament. The deal ended more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July election.



Honduras' president declares a state of maximum alert. The Honduran military sends planes to pluck residents from their homes. The entire coast of Honduras is under a hurricane warning. Up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain is forecast in mountain areas of the country.

Hurricane Mitch hits Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds. Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area. "The hurricane has destroyed almost everything," said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island.

At least 32 people have been killed in Honduras. More than 150,000 people have fled to higher ground. Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba. The U.S. Agency for International Development sends two helicopters to Belize and Honduras.

At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch. That brings the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission says. The storm made landfall in Honduras on Friday night, the commission says. It is the deadliest hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Wilma in 1992.

In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch. In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner. Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph)

Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos says between 1,000 and 1,500 people are buried. That is in addition to at least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, he says. The area is a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) area.

EU approves 6.4 million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for victims. Aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Officials in Central America estimated about 7,000 people have died in the region. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an estimated 5,000 died.

The pope urges "all public and private institutions and all men of good will" to do all they can "in this grave moment of destruction and death" Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America. Among those attending the audience were six Russian cosmonauts taking a special course in Italy.

President Bill Clinton orders 36 million in food, fuel and other aid to Central America. Mexico sends 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes. The U.N. World Food Program says it is pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome.

Foreign aid and pledges of assistance pour into Central America. Damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching hundreds of isolated communities. In many nearby villages, residents have gone days without potable water or food. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to visit Nicaragua on Friday.



Fidel Castro says the case against Augusto Pinochet is "unprecedented and unusual" Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his rule.

Chile sends delegation to London to argue for Pinochet's release. British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital. Spain wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power. Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances.

Pinochet had drinks with Lady Thatcher and her husband four days before he was hospitalized. The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish magistrate's request. He has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture. Chile's ambassador delivered a formal protest to the Foreign Office on Monday.

Blair: "This is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government" Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman: "The government should not have any opinion about the extradition" British police, acting on an international arrest warrant from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, detained the ailing general on Friday.

A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial. "There is a climate of division, confrontation and instability in Chile," says parliamentary deputy Alberto Espina. Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite him.

"Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes, wherever they take place, cannot be left unpunished," European Commission President Jacques Santer says. Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate. A Spanish newspaper says the ailing retired general's family and aides have been shielding him from the details.

"This is very painful for our family," a tearful Lucia Pinochet says. Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful spinal disorder. He was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him.

Blair: "I've avoided commenting on that judicial process" Aznar: "It's important we don't talk nonsense about this issue. This is stupid" Pinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he'd gone for back surgery. He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him.

Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova says no investigation order has been given to federal banking authorities. Pinochet has been held at a London clinic since his arrest earlier this month. Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.

British lawyers argue that the arrest order sent from Spain is illegal. The general has diplomatic immunity for actions taken while in office. The Chilean air force has sent an ambulance plane to Britain in hope of the general's early release. The political and legal imbroglio could end if Britain's home secretary decides that the general should be released.



Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his arrest near Munich. Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence. Focus newsmagazine reported that the evidence turned over so far was not very strong.

Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib says the U.S. is looking for an "excuse" to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan. He heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden. The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.

FBI agents begin questioning relatives of victims of U.S. Embassy bombing. Blast in Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400. 11 people were killed and 85 were injured in bombing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Six men have been indicted in connection with the attack.

Two journalists are charged with encouraging Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh. They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any one for offenses related to national security. Police seized copies of the newspaper for reproducing a foreign interview of Osama Bin Laden. The liberal government hasn't recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan.

"Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin," Afghanistan's chief justice says. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned. "It's over, and America has not presented any evidence," the chief justice adds. The U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya were blamed on bin Laden.

Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden. The Islamic fundamentalist is accused of masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa. Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian agency wishing to help in Albania.

New evidence links owner of Sudanese factory to terrorist group, U.S. officials say. Salih Idris, owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, denies ties. Islamic Jihad receives money and sponsorship from bin Laden, officials said. Idris: "I have absolutely no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization"

White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the months before the attack. Officials say the raid was timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps. A 1976 executive order bars anyone working for the U.S. government from plotting or carrying out assassinations. But officials say the president has authority to target the "infrastructure" of terrorist groups.

An operative for Osama bin Laden was worried about the security of the "East Africa network" The organization, the author complained, had declared war against the United States. The writer, who federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, was to become one of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi a year later.

Informant has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years. Source worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996. Source is basis for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin Laden. It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, or hiding under government protection.



If players win, owners will be liable for about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries. If owners win, it will remove the last wild card the players had been holding. Most players are due to receive their first paychecks Nov. 15. The sides have not negotiated since last Tuesday.

Bob Greene: Larry Bird was a luminous exception to the governing rule in the NBA. Greene: He was the classic small-town prodigy, with the creativity of a big-city profiteer. He says the NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater heights than anyone imagined it could, but it now suffers from a sickness of the soul. Greene says Bird and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began during a college title showdown.

The NBA has never lost a regular-season game to labor strife. Both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts. Privately, officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled on Nov. 3 or even before December.

Patrick Ewing: "All we want is our fair share and we feel like they're trying to take that away from us" Billy Hunter: "I'm prepared to make a quantum leap. I don't think we're that far off" Both sides have privately said they don't expect to play a regular season game before December.

The NBA's deputy commissioner says the league will wait until after next week's meeting before deciding to cancel regular-season games. Patrick Ewing, the union president, and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting. The last formal meeting between both sides on Aug. 6 ended when Stern and the owners abruptly marched out.

First time in league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor dispute. Decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap. Owners said they would respond to proposal by Friday.

First time in league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games. Decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap. Owners said they would respond to the proposal by Friday.

The arbitrator's decision may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players. Neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling to speed up negotiations. The NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season because of the labor dispute. There is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid.

Bob Greene: NBA lockout is weird even by sports standards. He says it's the interests of the best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating discussion. Greene: Current arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions. Greene says if players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws for owners to collude.



The attack occurred in the village of Chiondo near Kasese, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west of the capital Kampala. The various rebel groups operating in the region often attack with knives or machetes. Uganda sent troops into the neighboring country to flush out the Allied Democratic Forces.

Rebel leader: "We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what we're fighting for" The site has been set up on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in Illinois. The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and political opponents.

Congolese rebels say they have entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo. The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa. Troops moving south from Kisangani, the largest city under rebel control, had made steady gains against Kindu.

Rebel commanders say they are poised to overrun an important government-held air base. The battle could determine the future of the two-month Congolese war. Thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu. If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, this will remove the last government stronghold.

Rebels are fighting to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. They have been fighting for three days for the strategic air base at Kindu. Government forces have been using the base to launch airstrikes and assemble ground troops. The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers in Kabila's army.

Rebels in eastern Congo say they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers. A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being evacuated from Kindu. A rebel military commander, who requested anonymity, said the plane was carrying troops. Neither claim could be confirmed independently.

Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga says the government forces failed to respond to Sunday's attacks. Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down. On Saturday, the rebels said they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting to land.

Rebels launch artillery barrage into government-held buildings and the airfield. On Saturday, the rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport. Rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu, which the government has used as a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in the east.

Inter-tribal rivalry, looting soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have wiped out half a million head of cattle. Congo's bucolic eastern region of green pastures, sparkling volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains has turned into a war zone. On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponents, and disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army took up arms.



Indonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders "difficult" He says he is concerned about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister. Anwar Ibrahim is accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia law.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could "drop dead" at any time. Anwar Ibrahim faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. The party leaders will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence.

Indonesian President B.J. Habibie may also stay away, his foreign minister says. Philippine President Joseph Estrada told business and political leaders in Singapore that he had not made up his mind. The two men, who have each been in power less than five months, met alois June 30.

Ambassador Jose Brillantes says he was called after the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President Joseph Estrada. He said he explained that following the 1986 "people power" revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Filipinos react "strongly" to "real and perceived violations of human rights" Anwar was fired as deputy premier in September and later arrested.

The 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum prepares for its November summit in Malaysia. The last time the region held its annual summit, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy wouldn't be the next victim of Asia's financial crisis. Last year's summit was criticized by some in Canada for cracking down on demonstrations against Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler.

Taiwan will send its chief economic planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit. Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders summit on Nov. 17-18 after "giving much thought" to an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province and argues that only sovereign nations are allowed to send heads of state.

Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region advise further reforms. Among the necessary steps is for countries to restructure their economies and corporations. The worsening financial gloom is likely to dominate talks at next week's summit in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia's most prominent dissident predicts that the country's prime minister will declare "a state of emergency"

Pacific Rim leaders will sample local dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit. Spicy delicacies on the menu are satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong and Indonesia.

U.S.-ASEAN Business Council members say they are confident in the future of Thailand's economy. The proposed economic reform legislation focuses on resolving the massive bad debt of private companies. The council's lobbying efforts with the U.S. and Southeast Asian governments have concentrated on removing tariffs and other barriers to overseas trade.

Malaysia imposed sweeping controls on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets. The move drew jeers from international investors and policy- makers. Now, Mahathir's allies say the controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund economy. Critics say it was predictable that capital controls would be a short-term tonic.



Israel's Cabinet will not vote on the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down on terrorism. Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority must fulfill all its commitments under the agreement, the Cabinet says. The Cabinet also wants Arafat to abrogate the Palestinian National Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction.

Hamas claims responsibility for the attack in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market. The Israeli cabinet suspends ratification of a peace agreement with the Palestinians. It also announces it will begin to build houses in the controversial Jewish settlement of Har Homa. A charred corpse, covered by a blanket, lay several meters away.

An explosives-rigged car blows up at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market. Two people are killed and at least 21 injured. The market is only meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing 16 months ago. Witnesses say they heard a series of explosions.

The Cabinet says it will not resume its debate or hold a vote on the accord until the Palestinian Authority has taken steps against terrorism. The decision comes less than three hours after a car rigged with explosives blew up in an outdoor market in downtown Jersualem. Two people were killed and 21 others were wounded in the attack for which the Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility.

"This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last," the group says in a leaflet faxed to news organizations. The leaflet could not immediately be authenticated, but its style was consistent with that of past communications from the group. An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility for the bombing.

"We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem," Netanyahu says. The radical group Islamic Jihad claims responsibility for the market bombing. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord.

"We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem," Netanyahu says. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says she expects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord. The radical group Islamic Jihad claims responsibility for the market bombing.

Israel wants Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to outlaw the military wings of Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them. Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord was to have begun this past week. Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem.

Islamic Holy War says it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market. Palestinian officials say they have jailed several of the small but radical group's members. The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack were identified as members of Islamic Holy War. The Palestinian cabinet, in a statement, accused "foreign forces" of standing behind the attack.

Relatives say Youssef Sughayer showed no sign that he was heading for a suicide mission. "Don't grieve for me," he wrote in a farewell note, according to relatives. The 21-year-old Palestinian was part of a secret cell of Islamic Holy War. His cellmates taught him about the glories of martyrdom, his brother says.



Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad calls for an investigation. Local newspapers splashed close-up photos of Anwar's badly bruised face for two days. Anwar pleaded innocent this week to five charges of sodomy and five of corruption. His arrest Sept. 20 was followed by street protests and hundreds of additional arrests.

Mahathir Mohamad has designated three heirs-apparent during his 17-year rule. On Sept. 2, he fired the last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him morally unfit for office. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before being detained. He is charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption.

EU expresses "deep concern" over reports of physical abuse of Anwar Ibrahim. Malaysia's former deputy-prime minister was arrested last month. PM Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office. Anwar pleaded innocent this week to charges of sodomy and corruption.

Anwar Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia. In the realm of cyberspace, though, he's top dog. Within hours of Anwar's recent speech, dozens of boot-legged recordings had been posted. Most of the Internet content about Anwar is false or unverifiable.

Indonesian President B.J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders "difficult" He says he is concerned about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister. Anwar Ibrahim is accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia law.

Munawar Ahmad Aness pleaded guilty to having sex with Anwar Ibrahim. He was sentenced to six months in jail. Aness then filed a letter of appeal through his lawyers. Another letter then appeared, saying Aness would not go through with the appeal. His lawyers say the second letter was a fraud.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could "drop dead" at any time. Anwar Ibrahim faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. The party leaders will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence.

Anwar Ibrahim's wife says authorities have denied lawyers access to her husband. Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention. He has been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and is to go on trial Nov. 2. All but five of those arrested under the ISA have been released.

Anwar Ibrahim was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2. He then began speaking out against the prime minister and was arrested Sept. 20. Trade minister Rafidah Aziz says there have only been a few demonstrations over Anwar's arrest. She says potential investors are still interested in investing in Malaysia.

Malaysia is on Asia's critical list, its economy teetering on the edge of disaster. Mahathir, the confident nation-builder, seems to be flailing as he watches his legacy crumble. Unlike in Indonesia, there has been little evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia.

North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain to feed its 23 million people. It managed last year to harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi says. Poor harvests, economic collapse and three years of floods and drought have produced chronic food shortages.

The visit has been delayed a month because of a dispute over 500 cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung. North Korea claimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul government agents force-fed them. The South Korean government said it would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North retracted its accusations.

Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a "third country" since fleeing North Korea last year. About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three years. All complained about severe food and fuel shortages in their country. The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945.

North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages. Officials warn against international complacency and hostility toward North Korea. The isolated communist country shows little willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its ruined economy. The Red Cross wants to focus its latest dlrs 9 million appeal on getting essential medicines and blankets.

Two-thirds of children under age seven suffer malnourishment, U.N. experts say. A survey carried out in September and October also showed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malNourished. Several years of flooding and droughts coupled with an economic downturn have heavily damaged crop production.

North Korea plans to send 317 athletes and officials to next month's Asian Games. It will be the largest sports delegation the communist country has sent abroad in recent years. North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games, in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated North Korea's farming and planned economy.

U.N. World Food Program supports 1.7 million hungry Cambodians. Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of modern child rearing are to blame. Cambodia has produced a rice surplus for export in the last two years and expects another this year. But 25 percent of rice-growing areas account for 75 percent of the surplus.

A police official says the North Koreans were forced to repatriate because some had resettled illegally in China. The official denies reports that the Chinese had disregarded requests for political asylum. North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages, having harvested only 3 million tons of grain this year.

Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, visited remote parts of North Korea last week. He said he saw children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores and other signs of malnutrition. Hall also brought back a bag of what officials called "substitute food"

More than five years of severe food shortages have led to devastating malnutrition in North Korea. 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted growth, a new study finds. The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korean, confirms reports by international aid workers. Even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients.



Bangkok Asian Games organizers dismiss reports that sports complex will not be completed on time. Organizers say construction of the complex is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month. Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company that owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the complex from being completed in time for the games.

Thailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games to a tough jury. The heads of the organizing committees from the 43 nations competing in the December event. "Everything is 99 percent completed," said Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Kuwait-based Olympic Council of Asia.

Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai play for Crystal Palace in the English First Division. Another, Yang Chen, plays in Germany, while Li Jinyu is with Nantes in France. China and South Korea will both field their Asian Games teams at a friendly warm-up match Nov. 22.

Saudi Arabia pulls out of the Asian Games, citing Ramadan and centenary celebrations. But suspicion arose that the real reason was the continued strain in relations. A Thai janitor stole precious jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989. Three Saudi diplomats were murdered in Bangkok in 1990 and 1991.

The three horses originally came from Iran, but arrived in Thailand after a training period in the United States. They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that they are disease-free. This is the first Asian Games in which competitors have been allowed to bring their own horses from abroad.

Saudi Arabia's top sports official, Prince Faisal bin Fahd, is studying a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia. The plea to reconsider was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah. Saudi Arabia's sudden announcement Wednesday that it is withdrawing its 105-member team shocked hosts Thailand.

India and Pakistan have fought three wars since becoming independent in 1947. A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant committed a foul sparked a fierce debate. The incident not only violated the sport's strict etiquette, but showed the distrust between the two neighbors. The match was one of the first as snooker made its Asian Games debut.

Bangkok is known worldwide for its titillating night life. Viagra is not available in drug stores, but is sold only in hospital pharmacies. A "Traditional Thai Massage Parlor" has been opened at the games' village. "I believe no one will try anything silly in Bangkok," says an Indian official.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej, world's longest-reigning monarch, opens Asian Games. Japan's Naoko Takahashi wins games' first gold medal in marathon run in early morning. 377 gold medals are at stake in 36 sports, including Asian specialities such as kabaddi.



Qin Yongmin is trying to legally register a human rights monitoring group. Qin says a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in illegal activities. Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three hours before being released. Blair should be landing in Beijing on Tuesday morning.

An Jun is the organizer of Corruption Watch, a group set up by dissidents. Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took him away Wednesday. They wanted a list of members with their work and home addresses, a human rights group says. Rampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China.

Zha Jianguo says Xu Wenli may be charged for links to "reactionary groups" Under China's vague State Security Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life in prison. 190 dissidents from around the country demand the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai.

Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin are accused of endangering national security. A third man, Wang Youcai, is accused of "inciting the overthrow of the government" All three men could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measures. The ruling Communist Party has resorted to the law to silence dissent.

Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin are accused of inciting the subversion of state power. They face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted under the harshest aspects of the law. Authorities have detained or questioned more than 30 people associated with the party in a 17-day-old crackdown.

Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to national security. His arrest set off strong protests from human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents. U.S. officials in Beijing urged the government to release Xu. Xu's wife, He Xintong, said she had still not been informed of the specific charge.

Wang Youcai, a founder of the China Democracy Party, will be tried on Dec. 17. He is accused of colluding with foreign enemies of China "to incite the subversion of state power" Wang was a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

Yao Zhenxian was released in April from a Chinese labor camp. He is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which was formed in June. Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers of the party. "The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly," Yao said at the airport.

Qin Yongmin, 45, has spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. He has recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist political party. His father, Qin Qinguo, 76, said he plans to hand the court a written plea for postponement. If the plea is ignored, he said he will walk out.

Trial of Wang Youcai, founder of the China Democracy Party, appears to be finished. Wang's wife: "I don't know what happens from here" The trial of Qin Yongmin, a veteran dissident, also continues for something over two hours. The families of both defendants protest their inability to hire defense lawyers.



Former Clinton strategist James Carville says he will not be muzzled. Carville: "I believe the Democrats have a much better chance of doing much better than anyone expects" Carville said he would rather do battle with Republicans than with his fellow Democrats. "If they want to fight with me, they can," he said.

President Clinton calls it an "astonishing" triumph of issues over investigations. The next 18 months will bring many surprises and many reversals of fortune. Tuesday was a great day for Vice President Al Gore, for at least three reasons. The better shape Clinton is in as his term ends, the better chance Gore stands in the presidential nomination process.

Gingrich's vision seems to have blurred this time around. Some members are trying to organize a slate of candidates to replace Gingrich and his leadership team. "People were very angry last night," one aide said. "Today it's a mixture of seething and dismay," another said.

Democrats pick up five seats in the House, GOP picks up just six. Republicans' new 223-211 majority is smallest since 1953. House Judiciary Committee chairman says only witness likely to be Kenneth Starr. Republicans discuss whether to mount leadership challenges in the next few weeks."We've got to reach out and have more than southern white males running the Washington Republican Party"

Democrats pick up five seats in the House, GOP picks up just six. House Judiciary Committee chairman says only witness likely to be Kenneth Starr. Republicans' new 223-211 majority amounted to the smallest congressional majority since 1953. Republicans discuss whether to mount leadership challenges in the next few weeks.

Rep. Bob Livingston and Rep. Newt Gingrich are fighting for control of the House. Gingrich fighting with a counter-campaign that has given some members pause about ousting him. A small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich. House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders.

Rep. Robert Livingston, R-N.Y., says he'll decide within 48 hours whether to challenge Gingrich. Gingrich's counter-campaign has given some members pause about ousting him. House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders. Gingrich could be denied re-election as speaker if at least five others refuse to vote.

Newt Gingrich's leadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the speaker's office, he is in danger of marginalization. Gingrich revolution was fueled by anger, a revolt of white working-class Americans. But old political habits and a moribund Republican leadership allowed Democrats to retain control of Congress.

Gingrich says he will not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote. He will leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January. "This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is in the system," he says. Gingrich's resignation was a stunning reversal for one of the most combative politicians.



Microsoft antitrust trial is the first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution and Microsoft's defense are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages. The e-mails are alive with ideas and competitive zeal, punctuated with profanity and exclamation points. In the trial, the two sides have submitted about 3,000 exhibits, mainly e- mail.

AOL would acquire Netscape's popular Web site and its software business. AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced as soon as Monday morning.

AOL, Netscape, Sun Microsystems Inc. in three-way transaction. AOL would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced as soon as Monday morning.

AOL is the nation's largest dial-up online service with more than 14 million subscribers. Microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the media-and-commerce business. Microsoft has the built-in advantage in any computer-based medium because its Windows operating system runs more than 90 percent of personal computers.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27. The record is the first since July 17, when the Dow closed at 9,337.97. For the year, the Dow is up 18.54 percent and has a chance of rising more than 20 percent. Monday's action was energized by a daily record for the number of mergers and acquisitions.

Microsoft says proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online undermines antitrust suit against the software giant. "From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the government," Microsoft official says. Government's lead attorney: "Whatever the deal ends up being ... is not going to remove any of the obstacles"

Netscape, America Online see convergence of technology and media. America Online hopes to secure a solid lead in a battle to transform cyberspace into a virtual mall. Sun Microsystems is a strong technology partner in developing Netscape's software. Netscape cofounder: "This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the next decade"

America Online is trying to buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems. Justice Department says Microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems to muscle rivals. Only four years ago, in his book "The Road Ahead," Bill Gates scarcely mentions the Internet. America Online remains dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement of an AOL icon.

America Online says it has ambitions to offer a wider array of software, consulting and services. Analysts say the leader today in e-commerce services is IBM. By 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market for electronic commerce services and software should top $35 billion. America Online faces a variety of problems in its new quest.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close at 7,632.53. The Dow's 12.4 percent slide in the third quarter, which ended Wednesday, was its worst quarterly performance in eight years. The selloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into U.S. Treasury securities.

President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies. Calls for Soviet-style controls have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet. Russia's stock market dropped by 5 percent to 38.8 Friday, but trading was so light the downward move meant little.

Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian economists. He urged the economists to come up with recommendations before a national meeting of economists in November. Ukraine has suffered economic problems since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. It has been especially hard hit by the financial crisis in neighboring Russia.

Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month. Leftist factions, which voted against the proposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee the return of savings. The fund would have accumulated money in a special National Bank account.

Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov says the economic crisis will not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing state property. Primakov reassured the businessmen that the government had no plans to ban the circulation of U.S. dollars in Russia. But, he said, the government would take steps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia.

Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov: "It has yet to be worked out" Primakov seeks to calm an anxious public worried that the Kremlin's cure could be worse than the disease. Primakov has called for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money supply. The plan also implies that Russians would be able to buy dollars at exchanges.

Finance ministers and central bankers gathered last year in Hong Kong. Many predicted troubles in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995. This year, in place of confident predictions, there are mutual recriminations. Hundreds of billions of dollars have fled from economies on four continents.

In 60 of the country's 89 statelike regions, more than 1,000 mail cars have been sidetracked. The state Railway Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on some 210 million rubles in old bills. "The situation is really extraordinary," said Vladimir Sherekhov, the deputy chief of mail service administration.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright gives first comprehensive review of U.S.-Russian relations. She says she is "deeply concerned" about Russia's direction and does not think the crisis will soon abate. The United States must keep up its aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote democracy and student exchanges, she says.

Communists working to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help run. Anger over Russia's fate is drawing some Russians back to Soviet-style slogans. Russia has seen nothing approaching this sort of economic chaos and despair since 1993. There seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any sort.



Eyewitnesses say they saw convoys of armored vehicles approaching the border. Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy. Relations are also strained by the growing military and diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel. Damascus claims that these ties destabilize the region.

Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border with Syria. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stressed Israel's hands-off approach to the escalating dispute. "We have no part in this tension," Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. "Israel is not interested in confrontation with Syria, but rather in finding ways to renew talks"

Mubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to reporters. Egypt's foreign minister says Mubarak backs dialogue for solving disputes. Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases. Editorials in the Arab world call on both sides to show restraint.

Mubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to reporters. Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases. Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984. Editorials in the Arab world call on both sides to show restraint.

Turkish President Suleyman Demirel says Turkey is in a position of self-defense. Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the Turkish-Syrian border. Egypt and Syria "agreed on the graveness of the situation," Syria's foreign minister says.

Iran plans to dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times reports. Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation. Tensions between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally, have escalated in recent days. Turkey long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish rebels.

Iran will dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times reports. Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation. Tensions between Turkey and Syria, Iran's closest Arab ally, have escalated in recent days. Turkey has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears of an attack.

President Elias Hrawi travels to Damascus to show Lebanon's support for Syria. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri says his country backs Syria in the dispute. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. Syria denied the allegation.

"Sources of tension are being created in our region," government spokesman Dimitris Reppas says. Greece accuses Turkey of undermining the whole region's stability through its stand-off with Syria. Turkish troops have reportedly massed on the frontier with Syria, while Ankara has indicated its readiness for cross-border raids.

President Elias Hrawi calls for a "diplomatic dialogue" to defuse the tension. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri says his country backs Syria in the dispute. Turkey has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears of an attack. Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party maintain camps in Lebanon.



United States maxi Sayonara looks set to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race. If the 80-footer beats the local boats home into Hobart, it will be third time in four years a foreign yacht has finished first. The race is tipped to start Saturday under freshening north easters with the prospect of showers and a thunder storm.

Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness are locked in a three-way duel. All three maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night's positioning report. Propelled for the most part by favorable northerly breezes, the leaders rocketed along at an average speed of 14 knots.

Major search under way in Bass Strait off Australia's southeast coast for injured crewman. Australian Navy has sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area. Earlier, a police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas.

Two crew members found dead on stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad. Seven colleagues winched aboard helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital. Three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion. A total of 37 yachting have been forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race.

NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part. The master alarm blared and red lights flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday. The one-day delay cost NASA about $600,000.

Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered the most difficult part of the mission. Such a "blind" docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. Three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight.

Astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday. It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. The union set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors.

Astronauts connect first two building blocks of the international space station. First time Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-America Unity touched. Zarya will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling station. Unity will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.

Zarya will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling station. Unity will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.

NASA, Russian Space Agency agree to set aside Russian request to launch new station closer to Mir. Request came too late to be acted on, NASA's space station program manager says. Move would have forced similar shifts in subsequent assembly flights, engineers say. U.S., 15 other nations plan to begin building new station next week.

A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour. It was the first time in three years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after the spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go. Another attempt is scheduled for Friday at 3:36am.

The shuttle Endeavour carries into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built part of an international space station. On their 12-day flight, the astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach it to the station. The project entails high risk, because of the technical difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space.

Astronauts on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station. The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits. Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder.



European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg says growth appears to be slowing in the euro-zone. He says domestic demand will continue to boost the economy. The bank has been under pressure from politicians to keep interest rates low to help boost growth. Unemployment in the 11 nations remains stubbornly high at 10.9 percent.

Ten of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate to 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The coordinated move was a key step in preparing for economic union. In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central bankers cut the key interest rate.

Ten of the 11 countries joining European economic union drop their key interest rate to 3 percent. Portugal makes the most significant plunge, from 3.75 percent to 3.2 percent. The exception was Italy, which cut from 4 to3.5 percent. Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the groundwork for monetary union.

Xinhua: China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial exchanges with 11 members of the European Union. Chinese officials have said the government may convert a proportion of its dlrs 145 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves into the euro. The 11 countries launching the common currency are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

A growing number of Danes believe their country should take part in the euro. Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of the monetary union for the time being. Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm supporters of the EU. It would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the new currency.

Annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November. The fall continued the steady decline of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year. In the 15 nation EU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent inNovember compared to 1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan.

Wim Duisenberg was named this spring as head of the new European Central Bank. He was elected easily but agreed to step down after four years of his eight year term. He has since said no such "gentleman's agreement" exists. He said that he would like to see further political integration in the area of foreign tax and social policies.

The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance. "This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century," French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn says. The euro would likely be worth 6.56 to 6.57 French francs, he says.

French authorities say Paris stock exchange will join London-Frankfurt alliance. The alliance is seen as the precursor of a pan-European market. Some doubt remains, however, about the timing and technicalities of the French entry. The New York Mercantile Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange are considering a merger.

The year 1999 is the official start-up date of the euro, the common European currency. Throughout Europe, a different kind of integration has already taken root. Mobile, fluent in several languages and aggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living the kind of cosmopolitan existence that the euro is supposed to advance.



Indonesia questions whether Portugal truly wants to settle the problem of East Timor. Portugal suspended talks with Indonesia in New York last week following reports of a massacre. The claims were made by East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops. Portugal's Foreign Ministry accused Indonesia of breaking promises to reduce its military presence.

Josi Ramos-Horta is an advocate of independence for Indonesian-controlled East Timor. Taiwan had formerly barred him to avoid antagonizing Indonesia. His previous persona non grata status had been ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in August. Opposition supporters alleged the incident Wednesday night was politically motivated.

Mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor. Troops and riot police patrolled the streets. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests. The violence was in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta.

The Australian military holds joint training exercises with Indonesian troops. The elite commando units accused of atrocities in East Timor. About 100 activists gathered outside the Canungra Land Warfare Center, south of Brisbane. "It is a peaceful protest against Australia training Indonesian soldiers," spokesman says.

About 100 activists gathered outside the Canungra Land Warfare Center, south of Brisbane. "It is a peaceful protest against Australia training Indonesian soldiers," spokesman says.

Indonesia invaded East Timor in Dec. 1975, following Portugal's colonial rule, and annexed it a month later. The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta. Indonesian troops have since then been fighting a small band of pro-independence guerillas. The United Nations is brokering talks between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's political future.

Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village, pro-independence groups say. The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian officials were not immediately available for comment. Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack.

The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian officials were not immediately available for comment. Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack.

EU leaders back calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor. The former Portuguese colony has been occupied by Indonesia since 1975. Indonesia has resisted such calls and maintains thousands of troops to keep order in the half-island territory. The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a "real and substantial reduction"

U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker is visiting Indonesia to promote a U.N.-designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony. Marker says both sides in the bitter conflict are displaying a newfound taste for compromise. Indonesia and Portugal will send diplomats to open "interest" sections in each other's capitals next month.



This year's winner will be announced Thursday. The Swedish Academy keeps its deliberations secret. A writer's nationality, by the terms of the prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, is supposed to be irrelevant. China "desperately" wants its first laureate, a professor says.

Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize in his name. He chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters. Questions about the prize have engaged and piqued the literary world ever since. A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday.

Jose Saramago's best-known work is "The Stone Raft," in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe. He is the fourth consecutive European to win the prestigious prize. Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose work combines comedy and social commentary.

Jose Saramago, 75, is the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. He is known for his hard-edged and iconoclastic views. His controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed with the establishment. He has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary prizes.

Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award. The 75-year-old joked about how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at Frankfurt airport. "I wasn't born to win the Nobel. I didn't have my own books until I was 18." His first novel, published in 1947 was a tale of peasants in moral crisis.

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has repeatedly been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. He could have won the prize in 1978 had it not been for strict deadline rules for nominations. That prize was shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David accords.

Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States win. They were given the prize for their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally.

Three U.S. researchers win the Nobel Medicine Prize. They discovered how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system. The breakthrough has applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally.

Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer to win the prize. He is also the fourth successive European to win. His novels often use the supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational as ways of addressing complex questions of faith and existence. His best-known books are "Baltasar and Blimunda," "The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis"

Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine goes to three American pharmacologists. Research led to new treatments for treating heart and lung diseases, shock and impotence. Discovery was the first discovery that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism. Drug companies are trying to develop more powerful heart drugs based on newer knowledge.



Ariel Sharon is being considered for the government's No. 2 post. He would be a pivotal figure in reaching a final peace settlement with the Palestinians. Sharon is the general who led Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to making a decision on the appointment.

Ariel Sharon was born in Kfar Mallal in British-ruled Palestine in 1928. He fought in the 1948 Mideast war and formed elite commando unit "101" In 1977, he was appointed minister of agriculture in the government of Menachem Begin. He was defense minister in the Begin government from 1981 to 1996.

Many Arabs know Ariel Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees. Sharon will be in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than two years ago.

Peace talks between Syria and Israel broke off more than two years ago. Lebanon's peace talks with Israel also have been suspended for more than 2 years.

"It is time to deliver," says Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. Yasser Arafat meets Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman to brief him on talks with U.S. officials. Palestinians express growing unease over the naming of Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's foreign minister. The four-day summit is set to begin Thursday.

Ariel Sharon is to his critics a caricature of right-wing intransigence. To his admirers he is a living symbol of unrelenting dedication to Israel's national survival. Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign minister is not a natural diplomat. Sharon has fought memorably, in virtually every major military engagement in his country's history.

Arik Sharon is an ardent advocate for Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make. Sharon will be drawn directly into the issue, since Netanyahu has appointed him to direct the final status talks. Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were divided in their reactions.

The most optimistic reading is that Ariel Sharon is prepared to make peace with the Palestinians and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed. Unfortunately, he is also capable of wrecking the entire peace effort. Much will depend on whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide.



IOC orders investigation into payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund amounted to a "bribe" The inquiry will be headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal.

IOC sets up special investigative panel to investigate allegations of vote-buying. Chief investigator refuses to rule out possibility of taking games away from Salt Lake City. Salt Lake organizers deny that the bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support.

The rules on gifts and benefits were in force during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics. "The finalist cities as well as third parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor, are forbidden to give IOC members any presents, liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other than souvenirs"

Marc Hodler alleges malpractices in the voting for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Salt Lake Games. Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's allegations.

Marc Hodler alleges malpractices in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment. Former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes.

Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada responds to allegations of systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games. Tsukada was vice chairman of the Japanese committee to invite the Olympics to Nagano. Nagano became the first Asian city to host the Winter Games since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 games.

Marc Hodler says he has been "muzzled" by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. Salt Lake organizing committee leader apologizes for alleged rules violations during 2002 Winter Games bid. IOC prepared to investigate allegations made by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host cities.

Marc Hodler says he was told not to appear at a scheduled routine news conference. Hodler: "No, I don't resign. But maybe I will be expelled. You never know" Hodler was, 3rd graf pvs, a Swiss member of the IOC executive board.

IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch promises to expel members if they are found guilty of accepting bribes. Samaranch says he was surprised at the allegations of corruption in the International Olympic Committee. Swiss member Marc Hodler said he believed four agents had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10 years.

Juan Antonio Samaranch says IOC members who accepted bribes could be expelled. Samaranch compared current climate to the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. IOC executive board member Marc Hodler says agents offered to sell I.O.C. members' votes. Hodler also claimed that Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free vans.



Gaza International Airport will open Sunday, Palestinian negotiators say. It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly in. U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to visit Gaza in December.

The airport has been nearly completed for months. It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport. U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to visit Gaza in December. All flights must be approved by Israel in advance, Israel's Channel 2 TV says.

"It's a glorious feeling of independence," a Palestinian says. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat planned to be on hand Tuesday morning. The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye River land-for-security deal. Israel will have a say over who and what is coming into the Gaza, but the Israeli monitors will operate discretely.

"This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian state," Arafat says. Israel continues to control the airspace and has the authority to shut down the airfield at any time. Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years. The airport will provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy.

Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years. The airport will provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy.

The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passengers, mostly Palestinian businessmen and students. Jordan agreed with the Palestinians earlier in the week on four weekly flights between them. Last weekend, the Palestinians inaugurated an airport in the Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord.

Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers. Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport. The airport's opening last month was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward statehood. Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence.

A plane bound for Amman, Jordan was delayed for two hours over an Israeli demand. Israeli officials also delayed a plane making a stopover from Saudi Arabia to Cairo. The airport's opening last month was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward statehood. Israel retains security control over flights arriving at Gaza International Airport.

Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday. The delay is the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. The planes were due to take off from a Palestinian airport in Ramallah, West Bank. The delays are the latest in a series of incidents involving Israeli security forces and Palestinians.



Moammar Gadhafi arrived by land for "a visit of brotherhood and rest," officials say. He met with Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and several government ministers. The trip was not announced in advance, though Ben Ali extended the invitation in August. It is his first known trip abroad since he broke a bone near his hip in July.

Louis Farrakhan congratulates Moammar Gadhafi on his recovery from a hip injury. State-run television shows the two meeting at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The Nation of Islam leader has made five visits to Libya in the past three years.

Secretary General Kofi Annan says he is extending his North African tour. The remark was made without elaboration at a news conference in Algiers. A Western diplomat says Annan will travel to Libya on Saturday to meet with authorities. The 1988 Pan Am bombing led to U.N. sanctions against Libya.

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan left for Libya Saturday to hold talks aimed at putting two suspects on trial for the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie. Annan's one-day, 2nd graf pvs will be shown on CNN.com.

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrives in Libya for talks. Meeting aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Libyan media: Gadhafi has no authority to hand over the suspects. Libya has been under U.S. and British sanctions since 1992.

An unnamed Libyan official says "a solution to this crisis is within reach" British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook says he is "very encouraged by what he tells me" U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan meets with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent. Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects.

"The talks have been fruitful and positive," Kofi Annan says. The United States is "disappointed" that Libya has not complied with U.N. resolutions. Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects. The bombing of a Pan Am airliner in 1988 killed 270 people.

Libya has accepted in principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. The hand over of the suspects has been held up over Libya's demand for a guarantee that they will be jailed in Libya. The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve their prison term in Britain. A total of 270 people on board and on ground were killed in the 1988 bombing.

Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani met Moammar Gadhafi in the desert. The television, monitored in Cairo, did not say where the meeting took place. The Qatari minister reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya, the television said.

NEW: "This was a very positive, emotional day," says a brother of one of the victims. NEW: "We pray on this anniversary that the families will find solace together in quiet remembrance," the queen says. The names of the 259 passengers and 11 of Lockerbie's own residents are read out in a service in London's Westminster Abbey. Simultaneous services are held at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia and Syracuse, New York.



Abdullah Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, in 1978. The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, mainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare. Turkey has asked for his extradition and he has asked to be granted political asylum. The PKK has used their bases in Syria and Iraq to wage cross-border operations.

Turkey considers Abdullah Ocalan a terrorist and its most-wanted criminal. "If Western European nations open their arms (to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem," Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit says. If Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, "he'll be tortured for certain," an Italian supporter says.

Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launch protests and hunger strikes. Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the Rome airport as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow. He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.

Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan is in prison custody in Rome. Greece has not officially responded to his arrest, which was welcomed by the U.S. But Greek government officials have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination. In the past, Greece has accused Ankara of waging a campaign of "genocide"

Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support for Ocalan. He was arrested Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He has, 3rd graf

Mario Calascibetta was taken hostage Sunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz. He is being held to push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted man. The Italian, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention in August, was due to be handed over Monday.

Italian authorities have turned back at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border. Most refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence permits. On Monday alone, about 70 people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point. Border crackdown designed to prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking to Rome.

Kurdish business leaders say the one-day shutdown cost their 1,000 businesses some dlrs 700,000. Kurdish students cut classes and workers didn't go to work. Some 41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to protest Ocalan's detention. The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader O Calan prompted widespread protests by Kurds.

Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is the first head of state of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria. Austrian police take special measures to ensure the safety of the visitor. The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last week in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan. Cyprus is among six countries with whom the EU started formal membership talks.

Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party. Germany also has a warrant out for his arrest on homicide charges. Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema is under pressure from leftists in his coalition to offer political asylum. "The last thing we wanted was an awkward and complicated situation," he says.



If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue. Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday. Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco.

If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue. Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday. Both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil.

Exxon, Mobil in talks to merge. Oil companies desperate for further savings. Oil prices have plunged 40 percent just this year. Analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, about 40,000 at Mobil, thousands would be likely to lose jobs.

On Monday alone, $40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent. Driving the resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market. Low crude-oil prices are driving oil giants into one another's arms. Smaller companies' still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers.

Philip K. Verleger: Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices. He says oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place where investors should be making money. He thinks we are heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil companies.

Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil. Internet and computer stocks also rallied, helped in part by the announcement on Tuesday of America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications. Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are scheduled to formally announce their merger on Monday. Whether Friday's gains will stick will not be known before Monday.

Exxon and Mobil confirm they are discussing ways to combine. Statement sent stock of both companies surging, suggesting investors believe the companies will combine. Analysts predicted that there would be huge cuts in duplicate staff from both companies. Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of Mobil would be worth about $70 billion.

Oil companies of all stripes are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration. With West Texas crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet that oil won't be selling for $100 a barrel by the turn of the century. BP Amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is little or no overlap.

Exxon and Mobil confirm they are discussing a possible merger. Deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth. Exxon-Mobil combination would be "like Ford merging with General Motors, Macy's with Gimbels," says antitrust lawyer. merger poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s.

Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company. Union leaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery. With mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 a year.



House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston says he had affairs in the past. "My fate is in your hands," he tells his Republican colleagues. He says he has sought spiritual counseling and received the forgiveness of his family. Republicans insist the debate over the president's fate will go forward.

Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President Clinton. His disclosure followed an investigation by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine. Flynt said earlier this year he wanted to expose the "hypocrisy" of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton.

House Democrats bellowed "You resign! You resign!" when Speaker-elect Robert Livingston called for President Clinton to quit. Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized upon the instant. Republicans rose to salute him as the ultimate political role model in the grueling impeachment process. "I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow," Livingston declared.

NEW: Clinton spokesman urges Livingston to reconsider. Rep. Bob Livingston says he will not serve as speaker and will quit Congress in six months. Decision leaves party leaderless on eve of the opening of the 106th Congress. Decision driven in part by anger of about a dozen conservatives in his party.

Frida Ghitis: The only thing certain now is uncertainty. She says the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would be needed to remove Clinton. Clinton intends to re-establish his authority while still in office, she says. Ghitis says history will remember Clinton as the second president ever to be impeached.

Rep. Bob Livingston resigned from his role as future speaker of the House. Julian Zelizer: No one should fall for Livingston's invitation to use his resignation as a model for resolving the crisis at the White House. He says the Senate must resist those Republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional process with demands for resignation. Zelizer says Senate must use upcoming Senate trial as a forum for finding a censure.

House votes 228-206 to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury. House also calls on Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office. Even before the vote, Republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Clinton spokesman: "The president has no intention of resigning"

Frida Ghitis: The will of the people meant nothing in the impeachment vote. She says the right was on the march and democracy was on a run. Ghitis says the GOP can no longer conceal that it is a party of extremists. She asks why so many moderates lined up like lackeys to follow the right wing.

Frida Ghitis: We no longer govern in Washington; we just roll around in the gutter. She says we have made the terms "surreal," "bizarre," "split-screen America," "shocking," "runaway train" and "politics of personal destruction" useless cliches. Ghitis says the Republicans have brought this sexual doomsday machine on themselves.

There were hardly enough shorthand terms or split screens to cover the activity. CBS went to a football game before the vote, becoming the only network to leave the news coverage. While Congress was debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire in Baghdad in one box. While the votes were in progress, the jockeying for the speaker's job heated up.



The Zarya module is a U.S.-funded component of the station. It will serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project. The unmanned launch is set for 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday. It has been delayed for one year mainly because of the cash-strapped Russian space agency.

NEW: NASA chief: "Because of the trust and mutual respect ... the international space station is going to be a reality" "Success," shouted one official some 10 minutes after the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit. Russian and U.S. officials said the launch was "flawless" and the module performed well during initial tests. The launch ushers in a new era of cooperation among former space-race rivals.

The first part of the international space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its initial orbit. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour.

Russian space officials give the first module of the international space station a routine tweak. Flight controllers fire one of the module's two maneuvering engines to raise it to an orbit about 230 kilometers (157 miles) in space. The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, lifted off Friday from the Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan.

Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered the most difficult part of the mission. Such a "blind" docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. Three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight.

Astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday. It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. The union set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors.

It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. The union set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables.

Astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman work on the seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay. Their No. 1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity, the American-made side of the space station. Their other job, time permitting, was trying to open a stuck antenna on Zarya, the Russian-built control module.

NASA, Russian Space Agency agree to set aside Russian request to launch new station closer to Mir. Request came too late to be acted on, NASA's space station program manager says. Move would have forced similar shifts in subsequent assembly flights, engineers say. U.S., 15 other nations plan to begin building new station next week.

Zarya, built in Russia with $240 million from the United States, is to be joined in two weeks by the first American module. The space shuttle Endeavour is to take off on Dec. 3 to rendezvous with Zarya and attach the two units. The station will cost at least $40 billion to build over the next five years.



Not since the early 1980s have so many countries been in recession. The crisis threatens to cripple Latin America's developing economies. A joint declaration will be signed Sunday in this ancient port city on the Douro River in northern Portugal. The heads of state and government from Latin America, Spain and Portugal will explore measures.

Leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing touches on Ibero-American summit declaration. Final declaration will be approved at Sunday's summit in this port city in northern Portugal. The draft declaration says recent financial market turmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly. The declaration addresses the world's seven richest nations.

Many factories fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end bonus. So they're considering paying with products instead of cash. Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things as hammers, nails, screws and bolts. "The idea is completely unacceptable," says head of Brazil's largest federation of trade unions.

IMF and Brazil agree Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit to zero by 2000. Brazil has lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign currency reserves since August. Brazil is the latest country to be hit by the financial crisis that began 15 months ago in Asia and then spread to Russia.

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso wants to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit. He's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. Cardoso is under pressure to repair an economy battered by the world financial turmoil.

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso wants to slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion reals) from the budget deficit. He's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia. Cardoso himself has promised to travel less and more cheaply. The full scope of his deficit-cutting plan is expected to be unveiled next week.

Voters return to the polls for runoff elections in 12 states and in the Federal District of Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso is in getting Congress to approve his economic program. Brazil has been caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year ago in Southeast Asia.

U.S. trade deficit widens by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion. So far this year, the trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year's levels. Exports to China have slowed dramatically and imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded.

Brazilian officials end four days of meetings with representatives of the International Monetary Fund. Officials offer only details on Brazil's plans for raising a primary account surplus over the next three years. With only five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said how the government planned to achieve the savings.

Details of the U.S. contribution, which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated. Congress has been alerted to the likelihood that the administration would have to act while Congress is in recess. The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund.



Rep. Kim Deog-ryong says he has "information" that two underground facilities captured on U.S. spy satellite photos may be nuclear plants. He says one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium. The other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting around 2004, he says. If true, the assertion paints a worse picture of suspected North Korean nuclear activity.

U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support for confronting North Korea. Kim Dae-jung pledged to "spare no effort" to resolve the nuclear question. Clinton also held a roundtable discussion with business leaders. Economics and security are Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia trip.

U.S. President Bill Clinton wins South Korea's support for confronting North Korea. Kim Dae-jung says his government will "spare no effort" to resolve the nuclear question. Clinton says the North risks closing the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S.-led inspection.

"Our People's Army will blow up the U.S. territory as a whole," official says. North Korea typically sends out belligerent rhetoric when it enters high-stake talks with Washington. The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday. Washington demands unconditional inspections of the North's underground project.

U.S. delegation will press for access to the site. American intelligence agencies believe it could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a frozen nuclear arms program. American officials have said spy satellites have recently photographed thousands of North Koreans around the huge site. North Korean officials have denied that it would be used to develop nuclear weapons.

Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, visited remote parts of North Korea last week. He said he saw children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores and other signs of malnutrition. Hall also brought back a bag of what officials called "substitute food"

North Korea demands U.S. pay hundreds of millions of dollars for right to inspect underground center. U.N. official: U. S. should pay "compensation for slandering and defaming my country" North Koreans have denied that complex is intended to be used for nuclear weapons program.

U.S. has long kept an unwritten list of foreign leaders it thinks should go. Diplomatic etiquette has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list from the White House rooftop. But last week, driven by frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the Clinton administration piped up.

President Clinton urges patience over Iraq's refusal to comply with U.N. weapons inspectors. Aides to Clinton deny that his comments represent any softening toward Iraq. Clinton is on a five-day trip to Japan, Korea and Guam. He is meeting with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung in Seoul.

President Clinton visits U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. "Lately, signs of danger have intensified," Clinton says. He points to recent North Korean missile tests, incursions into the south. Clinton plans to leave South Korea early Monday and return to Washington Monday night.



President Clinton says he would do it all over again "in a heartbeat" Clinton raises about $200,000 over lunch in Cleveland for a Democratic Senate candidate. He then flies to Philadelphia to raise half a million dollars for the Democratic Party. In Cleveland, protesters scattered along the president's motorcade route.

Rep. David Price is a centrist who has represented North Carolina for 12 years. Rep. Julia Carson is a House freshman who worked her way up in politics from the grass roots. Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure.

Dennis Rivera, president of the largest union in New York City, backs Rep. Charles E. Schumer. Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, endorsed Schumer and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. Rivera: "We are worried about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive into the next century"

National Republican Congressional Committee sponsors similar calls to small-business owners. Campaign finance watchdogs say the solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising. The calls are not placed by aides to Gingrich, by any of his offices or by anyone in Washington. They are made by people with headsets and computers at the home of a Congressional committee client.

George Voinovich is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by John Glenn. His Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, is running a grass-roots campaign. Boyle is campaigning hard on the issue of education. She is still trailing her Republican opponent by 10 percentage points in some polls.

Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., brought a nonbinding resolution condemning the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939. John Avlon: Shimkus' measure is an example of how members of Congress are spending their time. He says many Republicans are using the House floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that they can boast about to the folks back home.

Senate races have become the electoral equivalent of jury selection. The Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new disruptive force into the Senate contests. For most of the strategists involved in the races, there is little guidance on how to handle the impeachment issue. "I can't tell how this one is going to go," said Mike Russell, a Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman.

Human Rights Campaign likely to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election. White House officials, gay Democrats lobbying group to shift support to Rep. Charles Schumer. An endorsement by the group could prove important in swinging voters to D' amato. D'amato has sought to recast himself as a centrist.

Yugoslavia has questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia. Last week, it also refused to allow U.N. investigators to probe alleged atrocities in Serbia's southern Kosovo province. "The tribunal was founded to satanize Serbs," says a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign ministry.

The tribunal wants to look into allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000 driven from their homes since February. The U.N. Security Council should impose "measures which are sufficiently compelling," the judge says.

Yugoslav war crimes tribunal acquits Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners. Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, convicted of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. Hazim Delic and Esad Landzo convicted of three murders and torture of at least three other inmates. All four defendants had faced up to life imprisonment.

Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucics' deputy, found guilty of two murders. Esad Landzo was convicted of three murders and the torture of at least three other inmates.

U.N. war crimes tribunal acquits Bosnian Muslim Army commander of war crimes. Zdravko Mucic convicted of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of Geneva Conventions. Trial focused on brutal mistreatment of Bosnian Serbs during the 3 1/2-year conflict.

Zejnil Delalic was cleared of war crimes charges earlier this week. He spent 980 days in jail of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Three others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison terms. "More important is that acts commited by some weren't ordered by officers of our Bosnian Army," he says.

U.N. prosecutors seek to convince a three-judge panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide. The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992. He has pleaded guilty to 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic pleads guilty to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Prosecutors will be able to call evidence about the background of his murders. The trial also will give survivors of his killing spree chance to tell their story.

21 women, children and elderly members of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian forces. Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby was found by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother. A story emerges of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tanks, artillery and infantry.

Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far. He is accused of directing the attack on Srebrenica in 1995. Krstic was a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion. The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest.



Palestinian parliament speaker warns of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements. At least two Palestinians are injured in a confrontation outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel. Israeli ministers express dismay over clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops. Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accords.

Netanyahu says he will not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence. Palestinians claim Israel has violated the summit agreement reached in October. Palestinians see the Clinton trip as implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood. Israel has threatened to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback, scheduled for Dec. 18.

The radical Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip. Hamas carefully avoided making any threats against him. Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs, a group that has been involved in several violent incidents in the past.

U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived in Gaza to work with their Palestinian counterparts. Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to address members of the Palestine National Council. The Islamic militant group Hamas has been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat convenes senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a "firm hand" The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in recent days. Thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason.

Israel rejects a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners. The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation. The Palestine National Council meets on Monday in Clinton's presence. Clinton is unlikely to declare the PNC has not completed its task because that would mean his high-profile visit has been a failure.

David Rothkopf: On both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide, the political is also deeply personal. He says in the small and jostling confines of what few choose to call the Holy Land, the conflict touches all. Rothkapf: Clinton, this most American of presidents, has made Mideast peacemaking a kind of personal crusade.

NEW: Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon says Israel "has not left" the Wye River agreement. NEW: "We will not give up" on the land-for-security accord, Sharon says. Clinton to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. Thousands of police deployed throughout Israel during the Clinton visit.

Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians. Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit. Netanyahu affirmed what he told the president a day earlier that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday.

President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leaders. He is to speak at a meeting to formally revoke anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Israel demanded revocation of the clauses at U.S.-brokered negotiations last month that led to the latest land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.



Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support. The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate. The move is expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments. READ: Italy's Communists vote to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's coalition.

Premier Romano Prodi says he will appeal directly to Parliament to save his government. Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance is threatened by the defection of its Communist ally. Communist Refoundation Party says it will not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget.

"If we win the confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pass the baton," Prodi says. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest since World War II, was threatened with collapse. Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend.

Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition loses a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority. "I'm not bitter," Prodi said immediately after his government went down.

Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition loses confidence vote. Prodi immediately offers his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. President asks him to stay on as caretaker premier while head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier.

President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Romano Prodi to try again with a new majority. He could also name a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats. Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless his new government could stick to the policies of its old one.

Communist Refounding Party votes to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget. Prodi will meet on Monday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to discuss the political turbulence. Communist Refounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have pushed Prodi to the brink.

A leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction resigns in protest over the budget. "Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists," says Armando Cossuta. Prodi is expected to go to Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis. He could resign and seek new elections, which carries the risk of bringing opposition to power.

Romano Prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed. He may get a second chance to form a new majority, but even if he does, negotiations to that end could take days and even weeks. The collapse of his government after two and a half years suggests the chronic political instability that marked Italy for decades had sprung back to life.



A truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in breakaway Chechnya. Many of the victims are children, who dig the ground to look for ammunition. In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday in the republic. Chechenya considers itself an independent state, although no country recognizes it.

Chechen authorities find the severed heads of four kidnapped foreigners. The heads were identified as those of the four abducted foreigners by a bodyguard. They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya. British officials said they had not received any ransom demand for the missing men.

The severed heads of the hostages were found Tuesday. The men were working to restore phone services in the breakaway Russian republic. The EU says it will raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister, who is in Brussels for talks at NATO. "The senseless killing of the four hostages" is condemned, the EU says.

Chechen police are searching for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners. They were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. The deaths prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads into Chechnya. The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday.

One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed in a videotape that he and his fellow hostages were British spies. The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a news conference in Grozny. He refused to answer questions about it, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government had it.

Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny. He was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose severed heads were found Tuesday. Authorities speculate it was the work of an armed band seeking the release of one of its members.

Vincent Cochetel, 37, headed the regional office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia. He was seized by three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29. Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings and was apparently kidnapped, was also released.

Galina Starovoitova was a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament. She tried to run for president in the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down. She had said she would run again in 2000. There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months.

Galina Starovoitova was a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament. She was attacked in an apartment building along with her aide, Interfax news agency says. The report gave no other details. There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently.

Galina Starovoitova was a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament. She was attacked the entry way of an apartment building, police said.

Her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also seriously injured, Interfax news agency said. There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently.

Galina Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy in the lower house of parliament. She was gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her apartment. An aide was also shot and critically wounded. "It is one of the black pages in our modern history," Vladimir Putin says.

Galina Starovoitova was a member of parliament and a leader of a liberal party. She was shot three times in the head as she walked up the stairs of her apartment building. The killing had all the earmarkings of a contract hit, a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia.

Galina Starovoitova, 52, was a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party. She was shot dead by unidentified assailants on the stairs of her apartment building. Her aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was in a "clear" mind Monday, testifying to investigators. Police carried out raids and rounded up several suspects.

"To stop us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed," former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais says. Hundreds of people pack the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography Museum. Galina Starovoitova was shot to death Friday as she and an aide scaled the stairs to her apartment.

Galina Staravoitova, a legislator, was shot to death on Friday night. A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, was reported to be regaining consciousness in a hospital ward. Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoinova had received death threats. The motive for the killing remains unclear.

Galina Starovoitova was gunned down in the lobby of her apartment building, shot three times in the head. She was a member of the Russian parliament and a recently declared candidate for governor of the region around St. Petersburg. The least Yeltsin can do is to hunt down her killers and bring them to trial.



Torturers and bombers need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert says. Charles Villa-Vicencio is the research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The conference is examining mental health issues raised by the Truth Commission. It is charged with probing crimes committed by all sides in the anti-apartheid struggle.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on Thursday. The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white governments. The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations.

The 3,500-page report culminates more than two years of nationwide hearings. The release of the document is a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. With the ANC now in power and facing an election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove damaging.

F.W. de Klerk says he will sue to block the release of the report. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission says it will "excise" his name from the report to avoid delaying its release. The report will be a detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history. It will recommend individual prosecutions.

Mandela acknowledges the ANC violated human rights during apartheid. The president is at odds with his deputy president over a report that has divided South Africa. The report has caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid. Mbeki took a hard line against the report, and indicated all ANC members must.

Key figures implicated in human rights abuses already are under investigation. They include two unnamed generals in the apartheid state's security apparatus. President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is among the targets. Prosecutors are ready to move forward pending the amnesty application of one.

F.W. de Klerk had objected to a finding that he was "an accessory after the fact" The ruling ANC also wants to block the commission findings about its conduct. Archbishop Desmond Tutu says he took such action with "great reluctance" The panel, created as a way of putting South Africa's brutal past to rest, has caused controversy.

South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued its final report on Thursday. The report found that the majority of gross violations of human rights were committed by the former state. It also found that members of the South African Defense Force committed gross violations on a wide scale.

The 3,500-page report of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission was released on Thursday. The report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white governments for the vast majority. It has fulfilled its mandate of telling the fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every political party in South Africa has denounced it.

South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission released a report last week. It names dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty. All of South Africa's political parties have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report.



Two men charged with kidnapping, aggravated robbery, attempted first-degree murder. Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, charged as accessories after the fact. Police say primary motive was robbery, but court papers indicate homosexuality may also have been a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a hate crime.

Two men charged with kidnapping, aggravated robbery, attempted first-degree murder. Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, charged as accessories after the fact. Matthew Shepard, 22, in a coma in critical condition. Police say primary motive was robbery, but court papers indicate homosexuality may also have been a factor.

Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches near the campus. A vigil at the hospital on Saturday evening drew about 500 people. Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have a hate crime law. President Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer appeals to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. Gay leaders hope death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation. Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws. Two men and two women have been charged in the case.

Matthew Shepard's death fanned outrage that followed word of last week's attack. Gay leaders hope death will galvanize Congress, state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation. Wyoming has been one of the nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate-crimes bills. President Clinton urges Congress to pass federal Hate Crimes Protection Act.

Frida Ghitis: Family Research Council co-hosted press conference on Matthew Shepard's death. She says it was latest salvo in six-month campaign by religious right to demonize gay people. Ghitis says ads imply homosexuality is disease in need of cure, linked to addiction, AIDS. GOP leaders tacitly approve of campaign, she says, with tacit approval of GOP leaders.

Fraternity float in college homecoming parade had "I'm Gay" spray-painted on it. Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming freshman, was savagely beaten. Fraternity chapter suspended seven members, said they had acted independently. Gay leaders say incident highlights hostility toward gay people in schools.

1,000 mourners attend Matthew Wayne Shepard's funeral in Casper, Wyoming. "Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded," cousin says. Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens of candlelight vigils.

Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz under pressure to step down. Allegations that he interfered in a privatization contract. Businessman Korkmaz Yigit says he was offered loans to buy state-run bank Turkbank. Government suspended privatization last month after audio tape emerged.

Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz. He is accused of interfering in the privatization of a bank and helping a businessman linked to a mobster. The political turmoil sent the Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent. But the premier vows to stay on, saying he was the victim of a conspiracy.

The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having ties to organized crime. He denies the charges. Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an indication of the government's chances of survival. If approved, the legislature will debate the motions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday.

Bulent Ecevit was asked to form a new government Wednesday. He is a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The invasion, after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece, has led to the division of the island. He was barred from politics in the years that followed a 1980 military coup.

Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs the support of 99 deputies of ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ciller has not said if she would back an EceVit-led government. Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power.

The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition. But Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him.

Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit says he will see President Suleyman Demirel Monday. He was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. He tried in vain to bring together political rivals in a coalition.

President Suleyman Demirel appears likely to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker. Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government. Turkey's parliament is split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right parties. Turkey has had only one Islamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections.

Islamic-oriented Virtue Party withholds immediate support for Yalim Erez. News reports say Virtue is holding out for a number of Cabinet seats. Erez, an independent lawmaker, is trying to form a coalition government that would include Virtue. Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed to any deal that would bring Virtue to power.

Bulent Ecevit has served as prime minister three times in the 1970s. He says he will immediately begin working to fashion a government that could command a majority. Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, have quietly told senior political figures that they do not want a quick election.



Three times since 1994, a sniper has used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor who performs abortion. U.S. and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York. Many women's clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions have been urged to take precautions.

The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated the mainstay of the only abortion clinic in Buffalo. The availability of abortion in the Buffalo area is a complex reality, one affected by class and education, medical training and the personal convictions of individual doctors. The number of abortions in the United States has been declining steadily since the first years after the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision.

James Kopp, 44, is wanted as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian. He is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester. Law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics. While he was in an Atlanta jail, Kopp was given the nickname Atomic Dog.

James Charles Kopp, 44, has last known address in St. Albans, Vt. U.S. attorney says Kopp is not considered a suspect at this time. Dr. Barnett Slepian, 52, was shot by a sniper outside his home on Oct. 23.

James Charles Kopp was in van with Randall Terry when he started Operation Rescue. Kopp followed Terry into jail on first day of Operation Rescue's "Siege of Atlanta" Kopp remained in jail for 40 days and adhered to Terry's orders not to give a real name to police or courts. After release, Kopp worked alongside Terry as group's power and influence surged.

Protesters call themselves street counselors and come to the clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed. They pray and they talk to women, hoping to change their minds. Most of the protesters were among the thousands of people arrested here in 1992. The number of clinics performing abortions in the Buffalo area has dropped.

The Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator has received five similar packages in the last year. The packages were delivered by a man who employees said resembled James Charles Kopp. Kopp is wanted for questioning as a witness about the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian.

Dorothy Hayes is a devoted opponent of abortion. She regularly plays host to a series of traveling speakers, priests and protesters. She is one of thousands of people who have opened their homes to the Lambs of Christ. While many disavow violent tactics, supporters of abortion rights say they bear some responsibility.

Attorney General Janet Reno is setting up a new investigative unit. The unit will examine the possibility that the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot. FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary. Some officials are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors.

Dr. Barnett Slepian was killed Oct. 23 by a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home. He was an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor by principle. He is the third doctor to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings at abortion clinics.



"It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz," a rescue leader says. Police say most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. The injured toll is lowered slightly to 180, but includes seven people who needed treatment at burn centers. The fire is the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978.

"It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out," a witness says. The fire is the deadliest in modern Swedish history. About 180 people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in intensive care. The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or children of immigrant.

NEW: Police say most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. NEW: About 180 people were taken to hospitals, including about 20 in serious condition. The fire is the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978. The dance hall was jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers.

"I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped," witness says. The fire is the deadliest in modern Swedish history. The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to have them, officials say. The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.

"It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out," a witness says. The fire is the deadliest in modern Swedish history. The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to have them, officials say. The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants.

A fire turns a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap. Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening. "The earlier information that police gave out was wrong," Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case said.

The fire gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene. The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening. The fire is the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.

"I haven't been able to sleep. I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead," one teen says. Police say another 173 people were injured, 20 of them severely. The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening. The blaze is the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history.

Mourners lay bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance outside the gutted building. Survivors have spoken angrily of what they saw as a slow and even obstructive response. The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received. Only 18 of the dead had been identified by midday Saturday.

"As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson," prosecutor says. Forensic experts identify another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40. Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant parentage.



San Diego fans shave their heads for a radio promotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox tickets for post-season play. "This was more a show of support for the team than it was for the one ticket," producer of "Jeff and Jer" show says. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding: "Padre fans are a cross-section from all over the county"

Chuck Knoblauch was booed at Yankee Stadium when his name was announced for the first time since he neglected to chase down a loose ball last Wednesday. The Yankees defeated the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second World Series in three years. "Just to face things and take it like a man and answer all the questions, although they're tough"

"I'm really feeling good," says Darryl Strawberry, who underwent colon surgery. Strawberry will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 days before returning home. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he will need one treatment of at least one hour a week. Strawberry is still hopeful about returning to play in 1999.

The New York Times says it is fitting that the World Series opens in Yankee Stadium. The Times says the word on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't measure up against the Yankees. Yet the truth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will crumple, the Times says.

The Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle with Jeter and Knoblauch. Kevin Brown is the best pitcher in this series, capable of winning three games if necessary. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston.

Umpires' collective bargaining agreement does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the World Series. Richie Garcia will be the crew chief and behind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a home run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly showing interference.

Bernie Williams has been aloof during this post-season, but has declined to discuss why. Williams does not know if he will sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season. There is a good chance the Yankees will not offer him the most lavish contract.

Yankees manager Joe Torre: "The pressure was on to get to the World Series" Bob Greene: Why should the Yankees be any different from the six teams that already fell off the bus? He says the three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball into football. Greene: Somehow the "playoffs" leave just about everybody feeling inadequate.

Tino Martinez is 5 for 30 with 10 strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in in the post-season. Martinez has blamed his paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much. The Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better or worse, while he tries to stay positive.

The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning. Chuck Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score. Five batters later, Tino Martinez smashed a grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed the Yankees to a 9-6 victory.



Most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women. Contraceptive measure would affect 1.2 million female federal employees of child-bearing age. Future of measure was in doubt because it was attached to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision. That provision could scuttle the spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the Postal Service.

Road would slice across edge of wildlife refuge and wilderness area on Aleutian Peninsula. Road would connect isolated village called King Cove to long-range air strip in town of Cold Bay. Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent. President Clinton likely to veto the measure, but final outcome may depend on whether road is inserted into spending bill.

Talks focus on education and Clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 teachers. Clinton postpones fund-raising tour in New York, cancels appearance in Florida. Both sides agree they will need to extend deadline beyond midnight Monday. Congress has passed only six of the 13 required spending bills.

White House trying to determine whether Democrats will accept a deal to finance departments of State, Justice and Commerce. Deal would put off until next March the contentious issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of counting people. Democrats balked at the idea of six months' financing for the census.

Negotiators meet into the night to hash out their disagreements over aid for schools, census and contraceptives. On education, both sides have agreed to spend more than $1 billion but disagree over how to spend it. They have given themselves another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion-worth of spending items.

White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles: "We don't have a deal" Both sides agree to spend more than $1 billion on education, but not on how to spend it. Republicans say local school districts should decide how the money is spent. Democrats express concern over White House positions on census and aid for farmers.

No one can vote on the package just yet, because it is not finished. Still unresolved is a dispute over whether airlines can create a "peanut-free" zone to protect passengers who are allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other members from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting the proposal.

Lawmakers were never able to agree on a budget resolution. This had not happened since congressional budget procedures were established in 1974. Without the discipline of such an overall plan, the Senate and the House could not pass eight of the 13 spending bills. The only way they could get this far was to resort to gimmicks.

No one can vote on the package just yet, because it is not finished. Still unresolved is a dispute over whether airlines can create a "peanut-free" zone to protect passengers who are allergic to peanuts. Only a handful of top-level bargainers were in the room for the final deal.



President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office says. It did not say what had caused the burns, which were visible in small bandages on his hand. The president was at an awards ceremony when the burns were spotted, the press office said.

The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health has long been a concern. "The doctors say now: Everything is more or less normal," his wife says. She says criticism of the president is normal, though offensive when it focused on anything other than his professional performance.

President Boris Yeltsin is on his first trip out of Russia since this spring. He appeared stiff and stumbled during another public ceremony in Tashkent. He and Uzbek President Islam Karimov later held a one-on-one summit as scheduled. The trip is his first high-profile foray since an economic crisis swamped Russia.

Boris Yeltsin is suffering from tracheobronchitis. He was to fly back to Moscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday as scheduled. He planned to move up all his scheduled meetings before returning home, aides said. The 67-year-old, 3rd graf pvs

Boris Yeltsin is taking antibiotics to ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever. The president insists he has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two years of his term. But after a series of health problems in recent years, every new ailment unleashes a flurry of speculation.

"Don't panic, Dad is OK," Yeltsin's daughter tells a newspaper. The president will probably not go into the office all week, his spokesman says. He is being treated with antibiotics and there are no plans to hospitalize him. A Communist lawmaker calls for "an urgent medical check ... on the president's health"

President Boris Yeltsin shows up unexpectedly at the Kremlin on Wednesday. He has a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short his first foreign visit in months. The upper house of parliament falls just 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down. The motion reflects growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that has generally supported him.

The Russian Constitution has a two-term limit for presidents. But Yeltsin's aides say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, does not count. The opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding an early resignation. A respiratory infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week.

The court will take at least a week to consider the issue. The Russian Constitution has a two-term limit for presidents. Yeltsin's aides say his first term does not count because it began before the Soviet Union collapsed. The opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding an early resignation.

Yeltsin has been suffering from bronchitis and a cold this week. He is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov says he wouldn't exclude the possibility of Yeltsin's resignation.



Microsoft's push into the Internet software business offers a window into the ways the company uses its market muscle to influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry. Some of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought by the Justice Department and 20 states. Microsoft adamantly denies that it has broken any laws in these or similar situations.

Judge orders Microsoft to comply with Justice Department's request to examine financial records. Microsoft had asked that the trial be delayed several more months to prepare a defense. The Justice Department and 20 states added two new people to their witness list to testify about Microsoft dealings with Apple and with Sun Microsystems.

Microsoft says book will be crucial part of its defense in antitrust trial. Justice Department and 20 states suing the software giant will find support in book. Microsoft contends that its Windows operating system and Internet Explorer browser are a single integrated product. Microsoft intends to use book as evidence that Netscape's troubles resulted largely from its own missteps.

The government is suing Microsoft over its Windows operating system. Government says Microsoft's contracts illegally stifle competition. Microsoft says its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers. Experts say courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary.

The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against industrial trusts. Farmers, laborers and small-business owners resented the trusts as vehicles of concentrated power. The growing antagonism for the trusts was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt.

Government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft has spanned Republican and Democratic administrations. But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated public policy. Now comes the antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday. Microsoft, today the most feared company in the software business, carries a stock-market value of nearly $234 billion.

The government is bringing a more ambitious, complicated case to trial than the one it filed in May. In May, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But the government recently asked that the judge hold a hearing on remedies, if it wins the case.

The Sherman Act was passed by Congress in 1890. It is the foundation on which federal antitrust law has been built. The act has been amended several times, elevating the crime to a felony. In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit.

Justice Department paints Bill Gates as Nixonian schemer in antitrust suit. Government seeks to establish pattern of threats and offers of payments by Gates. Some industry analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates who knows how to play hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company. Microsoft officials closely watching market surveys for any hint that the new image might be detracting from the company's world-famous brand name.



Police and soldiers block off street in front of house in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Detectives search yard of house surrounded by a high fence. Residents say four regular visitors to house used white 1989 Suzuki Samuri. Two men formally charged by Tanzanian magistrate in Aug. 7 embassy bombing.

No evidence of a planned attack was found, officials say. Police received "credible information" that Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives. Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the Aug. 7 bombings. Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted for those attacks.

"If anything happens to him, America will be responsible," leader says. Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers are fighting in neighboring Afghanistan. The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff and family members prior to the August bombing of Afghanistan.

Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib says the U.S. is looking for an "excuse" to launch another missile attack on Afghanistan. He heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden. The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.

FBI agents begin questioning relatives of victims of U.S. Embassy bombing. Blast in Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400. 11 people were killed and 85 were injured in bombing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Six men have been indicted in connection with the attack.

"Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin," Afghanistan's chief justice says. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned. "It's over, and America has not presented any evidence," the chief justice adds. The U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya were blamed on bin Laden.

New York Times: State Department ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks. The pattern of negligence demands examination by the Clinton administration and Congress. An Egyptian now believed to have been directly involved in the bombings outlined the Kenya plot to American intelligence officials last November. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific that it called for more than a temporary increase in security.

Two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A rarely used federal rule allows prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future "acts of violence and terrorism" A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office declined to say whether the authorities foresaw further threats of terrorism.

Grand jury returns 238-count indictment against Osama bin Laden. Indictment supersedes June indictment that included similar but less detailed charges. U.S. offers $5 million rewards for information leading to bin Laden's arrest or conviction. Bin Laden believed to be living in Afghanistan under protection of Taliban.

Judge agrees to review complaints by lawyers for three men arrested after embassy bombings. Lawyers say their clients are being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours a day. The defendants are allowed only brief periods of exercise in a barren room, called the rat cage. Two of the defendants have not been able to call their families.



Emile Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament on Oct. 15. The election is a formality since other candidates have little chance now that Syria has thrown its weight behind Lahoud. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and the United States, enjoys wide public and political support.

Walid Jumblatt says he and his party will not vote when Parliament elects the president. "Historically, we do not approve that a military man takes control of the country," he says. A boycott will hardly spoil the chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, but it could embolden others.

Lebanon's Parliament ratifies a constitutional amendment to clear the way for the election of the army's commander as president. Gen.

Rafik Hariri is still the front-runner to form the next government. He is "outraged" that only 62 of the 128 members in Parliament declared their support. The delay reflects the tug-of-war among the power brokers in the country. Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three times.

Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government. The move could be a bargaining tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership. The apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war.

Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government. Sources close to the prime minister said Hariri turned down the invitation from Emile Lahoud to select a new Cabinet. The dispute appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will be governed.

Rafik Hariri accuses President Emile Lahoud of violating the constitution. He demands that Lahoud admit that he acted unconstitutionally. Lahoud is an army commander who wants to assert his authority. Central bank officials try to calm fears about a run on the Lebanese pound.

Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three hours before being released. Blair should be landing in Beijing on Tuesday morning.

Releasing Liu Nianchun appears to be an attempt by the government to blunt international criticism. Human rights groups decry the Chinese government's timing as manipulative. Authorities released Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison term. China has been forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout the 1990s.

Xu Wenli is accused of subverting state power, a crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison. He is the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy Party tried in a three-week campaign. Police detain two of Xu's colleagues and keep watch on the homes of at least two others, friends say.

Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai are sentenced to 13 and 11 years in prison, respectively. Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition group of a potent organizer. Xu remained defiant during his tightly controlled trial on subversion charges. Security forces have orchestrated a concerted crackdown, trampling China's legal safeguards.

Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years. They were sentenced for trying to organize an opposition political party. "The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly," Fischer says. Fischer drew China's anger by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng.

Jiang vows to crush any challenges to Communist Party rule and preserve social stability. He demands that officials "talk politics," a euphemism for following party orders. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated the summary trials and convictions for subversion this week. The emphasis on stability and warnings to those who would disrupt it were reminiscent of Deng Xiaoping.

Zha Jianguo says he expects to be jailed, likely for a few years less than the 13 given Xu Wenli. "Democracy is a process, and in that process a small number of people will be sacrificed," he says. Zha says he and other China Democracy Party members will continue organizing and campaigning.

Xu Wenli, founder of the China Democracy Party, is sentenced to 13 years in prison. Wang Youcai, 32, was sentenced to 11 years for "subversion of state power" The punishment of a third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, has not been announced.
