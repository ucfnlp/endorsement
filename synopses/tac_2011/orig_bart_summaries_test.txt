A gunman shot girls in the head  "execution style" at an Amish school in Pennsylvania state on Monday, killing four and wounding at least six others. The gunman, a local truck driver Charles Roberts, was apparently  acting in "revenge" for an incident that happened to him 20 years ago. At least seven wounded children were taken to hospital from the  school at Nickel Mines, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of Philadelphia.

NEW: Three girls, all critical with gunshot wounds, admitted to hospital, TV station says. NEW: Officials at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center say more than one patient admitted. Police surrounded the one-room school late Monday morning. U.S. schools have been especially sensitive to threats after deadly shootings last week.

Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, apparently killed himself, police say. He apparently called his wife before the shooting, saying he was "acting out in revenge" Three children were found dead at the scene and seven others were taken to hospitals. The school has about 25 to 30 students, ages six to 13.

"He was just an ordinary person," a neighbor says of the gunman. Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, killed himself after opening fire at an Amish school, police say. Investigators are looking into the possibility the attack may have been related to the death of one of Roberts' children.

Charles Carl Roberts IV may have planned to molest the girls at the Amish school. Police have no evidence that he actually did. Roberts left one note for his wife, one for each of his three children and a note and checklist in his truck. The note to his wife talked about his anguish over the loss of the couple's newborn daughter.

Gov. Ed Rendell says he will ask Amish elders if they want state police protection. Westboro Baptist Church plans to demonstrate at funerals of five girls fatally shot. Church routinely pickets military funerals, saying God is displeased that U.S. tolerates homosexuals. In June, Rendell signed legislation into Pennsylvania law designed to restrict picketing.

Charles Carl Roberts IV said he was tormented by memories of molesting two young relatives. Investigators spoke to the two women, who would have been 4 or 5 at the time. "Both of them have no recollection of being sexually assaulted by Roberts," police say. Roberts stormed the school and shot 10 girls before turning the gun on himself.

A procession of 34 buggies and carriages carries the body of 7-year-old Naomi Rose Ebersol. The route wove past the home of Charles Carl Roberts IV, who took the girls hostage. The Amish have reached out to the family of the gunman, who committed suicide during the attack.

Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, held a steady job working nights driving a truck that collected milk. According to a driver who worked with Roberts, those farms included some where the children in the school lived. Police could offer no explanation for the killings. Roberts left what they described as rambling notes for his family.

Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, held a steady job working nights driving a truck that picked up milk from area dairy farms. Roberts, his wife and three children -- two boys and one girl ages about 1 to 7 -- lived in the tiny village of Georgetown, Pa., 55 miles west of Philadelphia.



China is the world's biggest prison for cyber-dissidents, Reporters Without Borders says. Only around 10 others known to be in prison for posting criticisms of governments online. Some regimes are trying to "ape" China in restricting freedom of information on the Internet, it adds.

US Department of Homeland Security monitoring "anomalous" activity on the Internet. Three of the 13 domain name system (DNS) servers that control global Internet traffic were hit with a "denial of service" attack. Attack was coming from PCs taken over by hackers to create zombie networks or "botnets"

Hackers briefly overwhelmed at least three of the 13 computers that help manage global computer traffic. Homeland Security Department confirms it is monitoring what it called "anomalous" Internet traffic. The motive for the attacks was unclear, said Duane Wessels, a researcher at the San Diego Supercomputing Center.

VeriSign Inc. will spend more than $100 million (euro77 million) in a massive infrastructure upgrade. The overall investment is slated to boost capacity tenfold by 2010. Industry experts said VeriSign's investment comes at a critical time for the computing world. They pointed to hackers' powerful attacks this week as evidence of the mounting threat.

Government and university researchers have been exploring ways to redesign the Internet from scratch. Some of the challenges that led researchers to start thinking of clean-slate approaches include security, mobility and privacy. The Internet was designed to be open and flexible, and all users were assumed to be trustworthy. But spammers and hackers could easily cover their tracks by attaching fake return addresses onto data packets.

Programs secretly install themselves on thousands or even millions of personal computers. They band these computers together into an unwitting army of zombies. These systems, called botnets, are being blamed for the huge spike in spam. "It's the perfect crime, both low-risk and high-profit," one researcher says.

VeriSign is a leader in networking infrastructure. It manages registration for the .com and .net Internet domains. System is under increasing strain because of the explosion of human and machine Internet users. Project will offer a tenfold increase in the capacity of two root servers.

Internet security industry is in the midst of a major consolidation. Some of the biggest Web security companies now are subsidiaries of bigger companies. Analyst: "You can sort of hear the screeching noises of the vultures overhead" Consumer prices may not be affected much by the consolidation.

Police in central China's Hubei Province say they have arrested six people in connection with the spread of the notorious computer virus. The virus, which infects program files and flashes a picture of a panda holding three joss sticks, has been spreading through the Internet since December. It has infected millions of computers nationwide.

Singapore ranked second in Asia of having largest number of malicious activity per Internet user. Report said this ranking was due to a small population of Internet users, which meant that each incident carried more proportional weight. Data theft, data leakage and the creation of malicious code that targets specific organizations increased.

Juan Manuel Alvarez is accused of causing a 2005 Los Angeles train crash that killed 11 people. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty after charging him with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson. Defense attorneys had argued that Alvarez was only trying to kill himself when he drove his gasoline-soaked Jeep on train tracks in suburban Glendale.

Juan Alvarez asks for forgiveness from families of those killed in the 2005 disaster. Prosecutors allege that Alvarez had made not a suicide attempt, but a bid for attention from his wife. Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count of arson. He could face the death penalty if convicted.

Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count of arson. He could face the death penalty if convicted.

Jurors are asked to recommend whether Juan Alvarez should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison. The same panel found Alvarez guilty of 11 counts of first-degree murder. Alvarez parked his sport utility vehicle on railroad tracks, causing a train to derail. 11 people died and about 180 were injured.

Three years ago Saturday, 11 people were killed when a Metrolink train went off the rails. Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, is accused of 11 counts of murder, along with arson and train-wrecking charges. More than five dozen plaintiffs went after Metrolin in civil court; nearly 60 remain.

Juan Manuel Alvarez is charged with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson. He is accused of dousing his SUV with gasoline and leaving it on railroad tracks. Prosecutors say he wanted to kill people as a way to get attention from his estranged wife. The defense says he was looking for a place to light himself on fire.

Juan Manuel Alvarez faces 11 counts of murder, one count each of train wrecking and arson. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Alvarez was an admitted methamphetamine user at the time of the crash. Defense witnesses have testified Alvarez hallucinated that his wife's phantom lover slept in their bed.

Juan Manuel Alvarez was convicted of 11 counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson. He drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a Metrolink train disaster. The jury is not expected to reach a verdict on whether to recommend life in prison or death until late next week.

Jurors will decide whether Juan Manuel Alvarez will get the death penalty or spend life in prison. The sentencing phase of the trial follows his conviction last month on 11 counts of first-degree murder. The testimony of family members came on the first day of closing arguments for Alvarez's defense team. Jurors did not seem as moved emotionally as they were during the prosecution's presentation.



US scientists use DNA testing to identify the geographic origin of poached elephant tusks. Researchers hope to use their findings to concentrate efforts in the most active poaching regions of Africa. The researchers identified China's burgeoning economy as a "major force driving the black-market ivory trade"

UN agency CITES urges African states to overcome their deepening divide over a ban on the ivory trade and elephant conservation. The mainly southern and eastern African nations in the elephants' range, as well as Mali, submitted conflicting proposals for the triennial conference starting on June 3. They range from Tanzania's request to downgrade controls locally, to Kenya and Mali's joint proposal to maintain a complete ban on ivory trade for 20 years.

The 62-year-old bull elephant was found dead Saturday in Ratanakkiri province. Police say it appeared to have been fed jack fruit laced with rat poison. The elephant's tusks, measuring between 70 to 80 centimeters (about 32 inches) long each, were sawed off.

Police in western Japan arrest two brothers for allegedly trying to import nearly three tons of ivory. The arrest is a violation under the international ban on the trade in elephant tusks. Trading ivory was banned under the 1989 Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species. This was the largest amount of ivory ever seized in Japan.

Price of ivory has nearly quadrupled in recent years, prompting poachers to kill more elephants to sell their tusks illegally. Authorities are unsure where the illegal hunting is occurring. Seizure of more than six tons of ivory in Singapore in 2002 has helped solve part of that puzzle.

South Africa has been hugely successful in managing its elephant populations. But herds are growing at the rate of more than 5 percent a year and expected to double by 2020. The government is fearful of upsetting tourists who flock to see the Big Five animals. The country culled a total of 14,562 elephants between 1967 and 1994.

South Africa's environment minister proposes contraception and some culling. The proposals are part of a package of measures to slow rampant elephant population growth. "The government will never give a blank check to culling," Marthinus van Schalkwyk says. The country culled a total of 14,562 elephants between 1967 and 1994.

Experts say 1989 ban on international sales of ivory has been overwhelmed. Ivory prices have skyrocketed, incentives for killing elephants for their tusks have never been higher. Ivory is in demand for jewelry and, most commonly, for prized ``hankos'' in parts of East Asia.

DNA analysis of elephant tusks shows they came from a narrow region in southern Africa. Researchers say there is more ivory smuggling now than at any time since the ban started. Researchers in China have developed an environmentally friendly recycling method for circuit boards. The method uses technology similar to what might be found in a laser printer.

Zimbabwe's Parks and Wildlife Management Authority officials is preparing plans on how to deal with the proposal to ban international trade in ivory. The authority director general Morris Mutsambiwa said they have already discussed responses to the proposal by Kenya and Mali. He said Zimbabwe did not want a repeat of the last CITES meeting when some African countries disowned the common position that had been agreed.



Telomeres -- nubby strips of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes -- predict a man's risk of developing heart disease. Shorter telomeres indicate older cells and are thus a marker of biological ageing. British doctors measured the length of telomere in the chromosomes of white blood cells.

A certain gene variant predisposes women to heart disease, a new US study has found. Women with the gene variant were four times more likely to show signs of coronary artery disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women and accounts for 16.7 million total deaths worldwide each year.

When the heart is under stress, the blood appears to contain higher levels of a protein known as NT-proBNP. Might testing blood for this protein provide an advance warning of such events as heart attack and stroke? Study involved 987 people, mostly men, with stable coronary artery disease who were given blood and urine tests.

Researchers: Men with gum disease 63 percent more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer strikes more than 33,000 Americans each year and kills more than 30,000. Previous research suggested that people with infected gums may be more prone to heart disease. Over time, the bacterial infection can also cause loss of the bone that anchors the teeth.

The blood test measures levels of a substance known cryptically as a brain-type natriuretic peptide. Elevated levels of the peptide in the blood mean the heart is working too hard. Until now, doctors have limited the test's use to confirmation of heart failure. An estimated 71 million Americans have some form of cardiovascular disease.

The American Heart Association is launching a national "Go Red for Women" campaign. Only 13 percent of women view heart disease as a health threat, yet it is the No. 1 killer of women. Last year, the association raised $23 million for the campaign. This year's goal is $28 million.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) has become more prevalent among adults as well as children. Severe CHD has risen in adults by 85 percent and 22 percent in children during the 15-year study. Study measured prevalence, age and proportion of adults relative to children at four time points.

 telomeres, strands of DNA capping chromosomes that wear away with each cell division, may play a pivotal role in heart disease. Researchers from Leicester and Glasgow Universities in the United Kingdom found that people who have much shorter telomere are more likely to suffer from heart attacks. They also found that statins, which are better known for their cholesterol- lowering properties, appeared to alleviate the effects of Telomere damage.

British researchers have found why childhood trauma caused by abuse increases a person's risk of developing disease later in life. Researchers studying inflammation in the bloodstream at King's College London monitored 1,000 people in New Zealand from birth to the age of 32. People who reportedly have been physically or sexually abused, or rejected by their mothers at a young age, were twice as likely to have significant levels of C-reactive protein in their blood.

Postmenopausal women who live in areas with higher air pollution levels have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The higher and longer the exposure to air pollution, the bigger the threat. The risk of heart disease is higher than previously thought. Reducing fine particulate air pollution could result in less cardiovascular disease and fewer deaths.



Tanker carrying 15,000 tons of crude oil was holed by a barge off the coast of South Korea. Authorities battled to contain the oil inside a boom some eight kilometres (five miles) long. A fleet of 28 ships scattered dispersant chemicals or tried to pump up the spill.

 tanker carrying 15,000 tons of oil was pierced in three places. Spill triggered an emergency operation by about 40 coastguard and other ships. The tanker was anchored near waters designated as a national park. In the previous worst incident in South Korea, a tanker hit a rock in 1995.

A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker collided with another vessel in seas off South Korea's west coast. The collision left three holes in the 146,000-ton tanker Hebbei Spirit, leading to the leak, an official says. About 15,000 tons of crude oil was leaked, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry says.

A crane-carrying vessel slammed into a Hong Kong-registered oil tanker in seas off South Korea's west coast. The collision left holes in three containers aboard the 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Spirit. The leaked oil was about 15,000 tons or about 110,000 barrels.

A crane-carrying vessel slammed into a Hong Kong-registered oil tanker in seas off South Korea's west coast. The collision left holes in three containers aboard the 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Spirit. The spill released about 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons), officials said.

Coast Guard: 66,000 barrels of crude oil gushed from the 146,000-ton Hong Kong-registered ship. The site was about 6 nautical miles (7 miles; 11 kilometers) off Mallipo beach. A crane-carrying vessel slammed into the ship at around 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT Thursday) A spill in 1995, previously considered the largest, caused an estimated 73.5 billion won in damage.

66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons) of oil gushed from the 146,000-ton Hong Kong-registered tanker. Strong winds and prevailing currents meant oil was expected to start washing up on shore as early as Saturday morning. Maritime authorities set up a special fence 7.5 kilometers (5 miles) in length to try and contain the oil.

Oil from a damaged supertanker has reached South Korea's western shore. About 7 kilometers of coastline near Mallipo beach has been affected by the oil. The region is popular for its scenic beaches and is also the site of fish farms. It is unclear how serious the contamination was.

A band of oil about 3 miles long was snaking slowly toward the coast. The spill occurred when a vessel carrying a crane crashed into the tanker. The collision caused three gashes in the tanker's hull. The tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of crude oil.

The accident occurred at 07:15 a.m. local time (2215 GMT Thursday) in waters 6 miles northwest off the seashore of Taean Peninsula, South Chungcheon Province. The 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Sprit collided with a South Korean barge ship, the maritime police said. No casualties were reported during the accident.



Virginia Tech was founded in 1872 as a land-grant school to teach agriculture, military tactics, or the mechanical arts. The school, the largest university in Virginia, currently has some 25,000 full-time students on a campus encompassing more than 100 buildings and some 2,600 acres.

"There is no indication that this is an act of terrorism," the FBI says. The FBI is serving in an "assistance role only," a spokesman says. A gunman opened fire on classrooms at Virginia Tech University on Monday morning. At least 30 people were killed in the bloodiest school shooting in US history.

President and Mrs. Bush will attend the convocation at Virginia Tech at 2:00 pm (1800 GMT) Tuesday. 33 people were killed in the worst shooting rampage in modern US history. The White House says the president and his wife will attend a memorial service at the university.

Virginia Tech reported a campus shooting Monday. Students were told to stay inside their residences and away from windows. No further details were available on the incident. The shooting occurred on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. The incident is under investigation, authorities say.

The gunman was killed, bringing to death toll to 31, but it was unclear if he was shot by police or took his own life. The gunman opened fire in a dorm and classroom at Virginia Tech on Monday, killing at least 30 people. It was the deadliest shooting rampage in U.S. history.

The first 911 call about the shootings was made to university police at 7:15 a.m. Virginia Tech has canceled all classes. The report of a second shooter turned out to be erroneous. The gunman ``in custody'' killed himself. The university community is urged to be cautious and are asked to contact Virginia Tech Police if you observe anything suspicious.

The gunman killed himself after the second round of killings, the police said. It was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history. Questions were immediately raised about whether university officials had responded adequately to the shootings. The university did not send a campuswide alert until the second incident had begun.

It is not immediately known if there is any Chinese students among the killed or wounded. U.S. media reported that a total of 32 people, including the gunman, were killed and 29 others wounded in the shooting rampage. This was the deadliest shooting accident that took place in a campus in the U.s. history.

Virginia Tech President Charles Steger said Tuesday all classes for the rest of the week at the university have been cancelled. More than 1,000 students were affected by the storm, according to reports. The university is closed for the remainder of the day and will reopen on Tuesday.

U.S. President George W. Bush said at the memorial service held at Virginia Tech Tuesday that the shooting rampage marked "a day of sadness" for the entire nation. "This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community and it is aday of sadness for our entire nation," Bush said.



"There's plenty of outrage," White House spokesman Tony Snow says. The army is investigating conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. An independent review group also will be formed to look into outpatient care and administrative process. The action follows an investigation by the Washington Post that found bureaucratic snafus.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates says no one in the Army chain of command has offered to resign. Gates spoke to reporters after visiting the medical compound. Walter Reed's reputation as a premier caregiver for soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan has taken a severe hit. Gates announced that two former Army secretaries, Togo West and Jack Marsh, would head an independent panel.

White House, congressional leaders call for swift investigation, repair of Walter Reed. Top Army officials visit Building 18, the decrepit former hotel housing more than 80 recovering soldiers. Army has agreed to fund what he called a ''surge plan'' that has been designed for the likelihood that the 21,500-person troop increase in Iraq will result in more casualties.

The Washington Post investigated conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. It found that veterans' rooms are rank, bureaucratic hassles and physical squalor. Administrators' neglect of patients' mental and physical health borders on the criminal. Many veterans leave Walter Reed without the compensation they clearly deserve.

Army vice chief of staff vows to overhaul Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Building 18. Building 18 is a dilapidated former hotel that houses wounded soldiers as outpatients. Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., blasts Army, says it has known for years about shortcomings at Walter Reed. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., echoed Davis' concerns.

Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley criticizes Washington Post series on Walter Reed. Kiley says series unfairly characterized living conditions and care for soldiers. Army and Defense Department leaders have promised to repair squalid conditions in Building 18. Building 18 is a former hotel where 76 wounded soldiers are housed as outpatients.

Walter Reed's Building 18 was described in a Sunday Washington Post story. The article said it was full of mice, cockroaches, stained carpets, cheap mattresses. Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley says the problems were not serious, and there weren't a lot of them. Kiley also seemed to miss a larger point: Walter Reed's problem is bureaucracy.

The Washington Post last week gave the Army six days to respond to its investigation. Army's public affairs office summoned journalists from other news organizations to a briefing. The Army's chief of media relations said the timing was dictated by upcoming stories. The Post stories detailed inadequate care for wounded veterans at Walter Reed.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates names review panel to investigate Walter Reed. Gates says some soldiers involved in problems have been removed from their positions. Senate Armed Services Committee has tentatively scheduled hearings on the facility for March 6. Report due within 45 days and will be made public, Gates says.

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates says he will move swiftly to improve conditions at Walter Reed. He warns that senior officials will be held accountable for the poor conditions. Gates announced the creation of an eight-member commission to examine conditions. The commission will also look at conditions at the National Naval Medical Center nearby.



Police identify the shooter as Robert Hawkins, 19, and say he was armed with an SKS assault rifle. Hawkins' landlady says he had recently broken up with his girlfriend. The shooting "appears to be very random and without provocation," police chief says. President George W. Bush expresses sadness after learning about the shooting.

NEW: Police identify the shooter as a 19-year-old man named Robert Hawkins. NEW: Hawkins' mother walked into a sheriff's office with a note that "could be interpreted as suicidal" NEW: The shooting took place as President George W. Bush headed back to Washington. The shooting is the latest in a series of shootings in the United States.

NEW: Police use a bomb robot to access a Jeep Cherokee left in the mall parking lot. Robert A. Hawkins, 19, had a criminal record for drug and alcohol offenses. He had recently split with his girlfriend and was fired from his job at McDonald's. Hawkins and his sons showed her an SKS semiautomatic Russian military rifle.

Robert A. Hawkins, 19, had a criminal record for drug and alcohol offenses. Hawkins had recently split with his girlfriend and was fired from his job at McDonald's. He had a military-style haircut and a black backpack, and wore a camouflage vest. The night before the shooting, Hawkins showed her an SKS semiautomatic Russian military rifle.

Robert Hawkins, 19, killed eight people and himself in a shooting rampage at an Omaha shopping mall. Hawkins had a history of depression but seemed to be doing better since moving in with a friend's family. But about two weeks ago he broke up with his longtime girlfriend, and this week he was fired from his job. "I had a feeling it could be him," says a nurse who took Hawkins in.

Omaha police say the gunman may have smuggled an assault rifle into the mall. The shooter, 19-year-old Robert A. Hawkins, killed six employees and two customers, police say. Those at the mall huddled in dressing rooms and barricaded themselves in offices.

Police say the gunman may have smuggled an assault rifle into the mall. Surveillance video shows the teen concealing something in a hooded sweat shirt. The shooting spree was Nebraska's deadliest since January 1958. It was the second mass shooting at a U.S. mall this year.

NEW: Police believe gunman stole AK-47 from his stepfather's home. NEW: Surveillance video shows teen concealing something under a hooded sweat shirt. Robert A. Hawkins, 19, shot and killed eight people before killing himself, police say. Hawkins had a criminal record and had left or been kicked out of his parents' house.

"He was a very helpful young man, but he was quiet," a friend says. Robert A. Hawkins, 19, had been in trouble before. He was due in court later this month on charges he contributed to the delinquency of a minor. "He was depressed, and he had always been depressed," she says.

Police: Robert A. Hawkins, 19, of Bellevue, Neb., came into the store and looked around before leaving and returning with an assault rifle. Mall security officers noticed Hawkins briefly enter the Von Maur department store at Omaha's Westroads Mall earlier Wednesday. Hawkins lived with a friend's family. Hawkins apparently chose his victims randomly and spoke little or not at all while firing about 30 rounds.



FDA is "revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children," official says. Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been insufficiently tested in children, he says. Study: More than 1,500 children under 2 had serious health problems -- and three died -- after taking common cold medicines.

FDA is reviewing whether over-the-counter cough and cold remedies are safe for children. Critics are pushing for stricter warnings to prevent life-threatening overdoses. The review covers medicines that include decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants. The FDA has never approved dosing recommendations for the 0-2 age group for the drugs.

FDA: Don't give cough and cold medicines to children under 2 without a doctor's order. Parents should carefully follow directions for use that come with a medication, FDA says. Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee will meet Oct. 18-19 to discuss the use of cough, cold drugs by children.

J&amp;J says misuse could lead to overdoses "particularly in infants under two years of age" The products being recalled include infants' Tylenol Drops Plus Cold and Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant. Cough and cold products for children age 2 and over are not included in the recall.

Drug makers voluntarily pull kids' cold medicines off the market. The move comes less than two weeks after the U.S. government warned of potential health risks. Products aimed at children under the age of 2 are being removed from store shelves. CVS Caremark Corp. said it would remove the affected products as well as CVS-brand equivalents.

FDA is "revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children," official says. In high doses, cold medicines can affect the heart's electrical system, leading to arrhythmias. In rare cases, children have been injured even when given recommended doses. The FDA says it is too early to predict whether the review will lead to new regulations.

FDA safety experts urge an outright ban on cough and cold medicines for children under 6. The recommendation is the clearest signal yet that the agency may take strong action. The next step in the process will be a meeting of outside experts on Oct. 18-19 to examine the medicines' safety.

The voluntary withdrawal affects only products labeled for "infants," not those for use in children 2 and older. There is very little evidence that cough and cold medicines are effective in young children. There are growing reports that even children given recommended quantities of the medicines are at risk. A committee of outside experts will meet to consider the safety of these medicines.

The voluntary withdrawal affects only products labeled for use in infants. Some small companies could continue selling infant products. There are roughly 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold products. In the fiscal year that ended July 15, makers sold at least 41 million units of these products in the U.S.

The voluntary withdrawal affects only products labeled for use in infants. Some small companies could continue selling infant products. The withdrawal comes two weeks after safety reviewers urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children under 6. Even the industry's main trade group has recommended the products not be used on infants.



Study: Water needs of a rapidly expanding population test the limits of a river system. Report reaffirms a more pessimistic assessment of river hydrology that has emerged in recent years. The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.

Biggest problem in future of chronic drought would be water shortages. Seven Colorado basin states would battle each other for diminished Colorado River flows. Mexico, which has a share of the river under a 1944 treaty, would join conflict. California would come under pressure to build desalination plants on the coast.

Climate will be wetter in some places, drier in others, scientists say. Changing weather patterns will leave millions of people without dependable supplies of water. Global warming threatens water supplies in other ways, such as in glaciers. In wet or cold seasons, the glaciers act as mammoth storehouses for fresh water.

The Colorado River Delta was once a watery labyrinth of willow thickets, mesquite and cottonwood. 90 percent of the delta's wetlands and natural habitat dried up over the past half  century. Eight years of drought in the Colorado watershed have raised the likelihood of shortages in the near future.

Federal water managers say a shortage could be declared as early as 2010. California has the biggest water allocation and seniority rights in the Lower Basin. Without some very wet years, Lake Mead might never refill, hydrologists say. Arizona agriculture will bear the brunt of the shortfall and Nevada a small portion.

Desalination plant could convert billions of gallons of agriculture wastewater each year. Plant could preserve long-term storage in Lake Mead and protect Arizona from shortages. Plant embodied a destructive "use-it-up" attitude about water, environmental groups say. Plan faces its first test in early March, when the federal government restarts the plant.

$2.5 billion in water projects are planned or under way in four states. The scramble for water is driven by the realities of population growth. The Colorado River, a lifeline for more than 20 million people, is providing less water than it had. In Montana, officials have embarked on a long-term project to shore up old water rights.

Lake Mead is at 49 percent of capacity, a spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority says. The lake was lapping at the top of Hoover Dam just two decades ago. Now there are tense meetings among several states that rely on the Colorado River. The head of the water authority here attributes the drought's length and severity to climate change.

Lake Mead is in serious trouble because of a seven-year drought. Las Vegas responded with an all-out assault on wasteful attitudes. The city offered inducements to cut consumption, negotiated agreements with other regions. Nevada shares the Colorado River with six other states; Georgia competes for Chattahoochee.

The new accord spells out how three down-river states, California, Arizona and Nevada, will share the pain of river shortages. It puts in place new measures to encourage conservation and manage the two primary reservoirs. The accord is expected to forestall litigation that was likely to have arisen as fast-growing states jockey for water.



Tony Taylor is among four men charged with organizing and staging dogfights across US state border lines. Vick, 27, Purnell Peace, 35, and Quanis Phillips, 28 pleaded innocent last week. All three, as well as Taylor, face a maximum five-year prison sentence.

Tony Taylor, among four men charged with organizing and staging dogfights across US state border lines, has changed his plea to guilty. Vick, 27, Purnell Peace, 35, and Quanis Phillips, 28 pleaded innocent last week. All three, as well as Taylor, face a maximum five-year prison sentence if convicted.

Vick is accused with three others of conspiracy involving competitive dogfighting. Federal prosecutors allege operation operated on Vick's property in rural Surry County. They all face up to six years in prison, $350,000 in fines and restitution if convicted of both charges. Animal rights organizations have seized on the case as an opportunity to raise awareness.

Atlanta Falcons quarterback pleads not guilty to federal dogfighting charges. Vick apologizes to his mother and asks that judgment be withheld. He and three others entered their pleas in U.S. District Court. They face up to six years in prison, $350,000 in fines and restitution if convicted.

Tony Taylor, 34, says he was not promised any specific sentence. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities. He will be sentenced Dec. 14. Michael Vick and two other co-defendants pleaded not guilty last week to similar charges.

Feds are charging Michael Vick with holding pit bull dog fights on his property. NFL has ordered Vick to stay away from the Falcons' training camp. I've never really figured out why anybody would want to go to a dog fight. The fact that dog fights exist proves people will bet on just about anything.

Tony Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Va., has a plea-agreement hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. Monday. Taylor could get a lighter sentence through a plea deal. "Whoever is the first in line gets the best deal," former prosecutor says. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick and the two other co-defendants pleaded not guilty Thursday.

Tony Taylor pleads guilty to conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities. Taylor, Michael Vick, Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips face up to five years in prison. Prosecutors could recommend a lighter sentence for Taylor depending on how cooperative he is. Taylor's sentencing date set for Dec. 14.

Tony Taylor, 34, pleads guilty to conspiracy, sponsoring "a dog in an animal fighting venture" Taylor, Michael Vick, Purnell A. Peace, Quanis L. Phillips pleaded not guilty last week. As part of his deal, Taylor signed a 13-page statement that confirmed much of what the government asserted.

Michael Vick lost another endorsement Tuesday because of the dogfighting charges against him. Nike started the groundswell on July 19, vowing not to roll out his Air Zoom Vick V shoe. "Sponsors have almost no choice in this case," Frank Vuono, a sports marketing expert.



At least six people killed after bridge over the Mississippi river collapses. Several cars flung into the river and others crushed as parts of the bridge were sheared off. A semi-truck caught fire after it was sliced in half, while a busload of children was stranded on a collapsed section of the roadway.

At least six people were killed in the collapse of a bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. "We have confirmed six deaths and we are continuing the search," Mayor R.T. Rybak said. "This will be a very tragic night when it is over," he said.

At least three people were killed in the the collapse of a bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. "At this point, we have confirmation of three people that are dead on scene right now," official says. "I've been given estimates of somewhere between 50 and 100 cars that are in the river," official adds.

There are no signs that a terror attack was behind the collapse of a bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Department of Homesland Security says there are no indications of a nexus to terrorism at this time. State and local officials have the lead in rescue and response efforts, a DHS spokesperson says.

A bridge collapsed over the Mississippi river Wednesday leaving drivers stranded on massive chunks of concrete amid the rushing water. Several cars were flung into the river and there was no immediate news on how many people were hurt or killed. The 40-year-old bridge was undergoing repairs at the time of the accident.

"We think there are several more vehicles in the river we can't see yet," fire chief says. The collapse did not appear to be terrorism-related, governor says. About 20 families gather at an information center, looking for information on loved ones. The eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge was being repaired and two lanes were closed.

NEW: Death toll lowered to four. NEW: Crews resume cleanup and recovery work Thursday morning. Bridge was rated as "structurally deficient" two years ago, newspaper reports. More than 60 people were injured and as many as 50 vehicles were in the river, many of their occupants scrambling to shore.

As many as 30 people missing as the rescue effort shifts to recovery. Divers search for more bodies trapped beneath twisted steel and concrete slabs. Mayor R.T. Rybak says he expects the death toll to fluctuate throughout the day. Bridge rated as "structurally deficient" two years ago, newspaper reports.

President George W. Bush pledges federal assistance to victims' families. Divers search the Mississippi River for more bodies trapped in cars. As many as 30 people are missing, police chief says. The cause of the collapse is still unknown, a sheriff says, but it's not terrorism-related.

President Bush says the federal government will help rebuild the bridge. 12 vehicles have been located in the Mississippi River, officials say. The U.S. House passes a bill to help replace the bridge, but the Senate says it's too soon. The Interstate 35W span rated 50 on a scale of 100 for structural stability.



The rocket strike against the US embassy in Athens has revived fears of extreme- left violence. In the run-up to the Athens 2004 Olympics, the Greek police succeeded in dismantling the country's two deadliest groups. In 2003, a new outfit emerged with the know-how to carry out more destructive strikes.

Italian Foreign Minister Massimo d'Alema expresses solidarity with the U.S. The attack early Friday damaged the US embassy building but caused no casualties. Greek authorities are investigating a claim that an extreme left-wing group, Revolutionary Struggle, staged the attack. The Italian foreign minister also sent a message to his Greek counterpart Dora Bakoyannis.

Greek police say a far-left group, Revolutionary Struggle, claimed responsibility for the attack. "We all know from history that there are a number of these anarchist groups in Greece," spokesman says. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called US Ambassador Charles Ries earlier in the day.

U.S. praises Greek response to rocket attack on embassy in Athens. No casualties and only minor damage to the embassy. Attack claimed by far-left group called Revolutionary Struggle. US institutions, banks and companies in Greece were frequently targeted by militant groups in past decades.

The blast smashed glass in the front of the building near the U.S. emblem of the embassy. "This is an act of terrorism. We don't know where from," Attica Police Chief Asimakis Golfis says. "It was fired from street level," he adds.

Anti-tank shell fired at U.S. embassy in Athens, Greece. Blast struck the front of the building but caused no injuries. Police chief: "This is an act of terrorism. We don't know where from" Greece "strongly condemns" the attack on the heavily guarded building.

Greek police spent nearly 30 years hunting far-left terror groups. Now authorities say they are dealing with copycat militants styled on those 1970s radicals. They were blamed for Friday's attack on the U.S. Embassy in Athens. The pre-dawn rocket attack bore similarities to strikes by deadly groups such as November 17.

No injuries in rocket attack on U.S. Embassy in Athens, Greece. Small anti-tank missile narrowly missed the large blue-and-white U.s. seal on the embassy's facade. Authorities fear resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups. Pentagon has received a report on the attack but no request for any action.

A small anti-tank missile pierced the building above the front entrance early Friday morning. Greek authorities have said the attack probably was carried out by a domestic terror group. U.S. and Greek authorities are cooperating "to determine who's responsible," a State Department spokesman says.

U.S. Ambassador Charles Ries calls the attack "very serious" No warning had been given, ambassador says. Police identify the weapon as a 40-millimeter (1.57-inch) rocket-propelled grenade. Attack revives fears of a resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups.



A vast "mud volcano" has inundated villages on the island of Java. A gas well near Surabaya in East Java operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. has spewed steaming mud since May last year. Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Aburizal Bakrie has said little about the environmental disaster.

Sriwijaya Air had to postpone to January 29 the launch of its route between Malang and Surabaya. The service was designed to allow passengers to avoid the inundated Sidoarjo district. A gas well operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. has spewed steaming mud since May last year.

Mud volcano in Indonesia most likely caused by drilling for gas, study says. Volcano has been spewing steaming mud since May 29 last year. It erupted from a gas well near Surabaya, East Java, operated by Lapindo Brantas. As many as 13,000 people have fled their homes.

State-owned gas company Pertamina says compensation has not been agreed. Thirteen people were killed in the November explosion when the underground pipeline ruptured. Residents in the district objected to construction of a new three-kilometre pipeline parallel to the old one. A change in the route would shorten the pipe but bring it closer to the danger zone.

Mount Semeru in Indonesia's densely-populated East Java province spewed ash at the weekend. Winds had carried the ash from the 3,676-metre (12,277-foot) volcano to the town of Lumajang. Officials said the ash rain that had coated everything in the town was not a source of concern for residents.

Indonesian environmental watchdog says it has filed suit against mining company and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. A gas well near Surabaya in East Java has spewed steaming mud since May last year. Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the Sidoarjo district.

Key railway line threatened by a massive "mud volcano" will be relocated, officials say. A gas well near Surabaya in East Java has spewed steaming mud since May last year. The advancing sea of mud is now threatening to swamp the railway. The government will shift the track, which currently runs very close to the mud volcano zone.

Hundreds of concrete balls will be dropped into a "mud volcano" on Wednesday. Officials say they hope the balls can slow down the flow by between 50 and 70 percent. A gas well near Surabaya, in East Java, has spewed steaming mud since May last year. The advancing sea of mud is now threatening to swamp a key railway.

Indonesian authorities postpone start of attempt to slow a massive mudflow which has swallowed villages. A gas well near Surabaya in East Java has spewed steaming mud since May last year. The attempt to plug the "mud volcano" involves dropping hundreds of concrete balls chained together in groups into the well.

Leading Indonesian environmental group has filed a suit against President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and an energy firm on mud flow. The accident of oil drilling in May last year caused hot mud pouring into surrounding area and inundated entire villages in Siduarjo in East Java. The Indonesian government has been criticized for not doing enough to handle the problem.



Warmer temperatures have caused the Arctic ice cap to melt, shrinking the bears' hunting grounds. Hunters, who can get up to 2,685 euros (3,500 dollars) for a bear pelt, had been killing around 250 bears a year. The quota for 2007 has now been reduced to 139.

Researchers say climate warming is the likely cause. The study suggests the local bear population could be harmed if warming continues. Bears that continued to den on ice moved away from ice that was thinner or unstable. Conservation groups want polar bears to be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

The groups say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not fully consider the effects of global warming. The lawsuit focuses on the legal "incidental taking" of polar bears and walruses. The Marine Mammal Protection Act imposes a general moratorium on the taking of marine mammals.

Environmentalists, hunters, oil industry representatives speak at public hearing. Some speakers say scientific evidence supports listing of polar bears as threatened. Others say listing could hurt hunting industry, whose revenues help local economies. Final decision on the listing is due by January 2008, Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments.

Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne would not specify how climate change effects on possibly threatened species might alter the administration's opposition to mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Last December, Kempthorn proposed designating polar bears as a "threatened" species deserving of federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. "We need to see where this is going to finally end up with the polar bear," he said.

Bush administration is proposing to list the polar bear as a threatened species. John Avlon: Such a listing would have symbolic and practical importance. He says it's hard to act to preserve polar bear habitat without reducing fossil fuel consumption.Avlon: The administration made the right decision when confronted with the need to make a decision.

Polar bear threatened under Endangered Species Act because of loss of sea ice. David Frum: This is the first legally binding admission by the Bush administration of global warming. He says the only way to avoid jeopardizing the polar bear is to reduce emissions. Frum says polar bears are not the first species to have sought protections because of warming.

Polar bears are the kings of the Arctic, having adapted to an environment where few predators can survive. NASA: Arctic Ocean has lost about 20 percent of its sea ice since the 1970s. Some scientists project a further 30 percent decline by midcentury as Earth continues to warm. U.S. officials have limited ability to do much by themselves to slow and reverse this warming.

Internal Fish and Wildlife Service memos appear to require employees not to discuss climate change, polar bears or sea ice. In December, the Bush administration proposed listing polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Environmentalists are trying to use such a listing to force the U.S. to restrict heat-trapping gases.

Two Alaska scientists are barred from speaking about polar bears, climate change or sea ice. The rule was issued last month by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "It's a gag order," says Deborah Williams, a former high-level Interior Department official. The federal government has proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species.



Journalist throws shoes at President George W. Bush on his farewell visit to Iraq. Muntazer al-Zaidi shouted "It is the farewell kiss, you dog" and threw his footwear. Bush laughed off the incident, saying: "It doesn't bother me. If you want the facts, it was a size 10 shoe"

A man threw his shoes at President George W. Bush and was dragged away by security officials. Bush ducked and wasn't hit by either shoe. The incident occurred as Bush was appearing Sunday with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Bush joked that all he can report was that it was a size 10 shoe.

"This is the end!" shouted the man, later identified as Muntadar al-Zeidi. Bush ducked both shoes as they whizzed past his head and landed with a thud against the wall behind him. "All I can report," Bush joked of the incident, "is a size 10"

NEW: Christian band that had expected to perform for President George W. Bush on Sunday night in Washington does not mind that the show would go on without him. NEW: "So what if the guy threw a shoe at me?" Bush said, comparing the action to political protests in the United States. The shoe attack came as Bush and al-Maliki were about to shake hands. In Iraqi culture, throwing shoes at someone is a sign of contempt.

President Bush talks about al-Qaida 19 times at Rose Garden news conference. Bush: Al-Qaida is a threat to your children, NBC's David Gregory says. Bush touts success of chief operating officer position of al-Qaeda. Bush appears to be in good spirits as he walks briskly across the lawn.

"This is a farewell kiss!" the man yelled as he threw the shoes. Bush had to duck out of the way, and narrowly missed being hit. The incident lent an air of chaos and farce to a trip intended to highlight improving security. Bush was scheduled to meet with U.S. troops and Iraqi leaders.

The shoe-thrower is identified as Muntadar al-Zeidi, a correspondent for Al-Baghdadia. He was one of several Iraqi journalists attending the Sunday evening news conference. The first shoe flew over the heads of other journalists and might have hit Bush square in the face.

Muntader al-Zaidi, 28, is a correspondent for Al Baghdadia, an independent Iraqi station. He shouted in Arabic: "This is a gift from the Iraqis; this is the farewell kiss, you dog!" He then threw a shoe at Bush, who ducked and narrowly avoided it. Chaos ensued as a scrum of al-Maliki's security agents jumped on the man.

Reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and threw his two shoes one by one at the president. Bush ducked and thus narrowly missed the attack, raising chaos in the hall in Baghdad's heavily- fortified Green Zone. Bush was attending a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.

Muntadhar al-Zaidi, reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and threw his two shoes one by one at the president. "This is a farewell kiss, dog," said Zaidi. Several security members wrestled the man to the floor and then dragged him out of the hall as he was screaming.



Sleep deprivation can stress the heart and raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, study says. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine tested 39 volunteers. The study found that a sleep deficit built up over just five nights can impair heart function. The findings are consistent with previous research showing that shift workers are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease.

Japanese study says early-risers are at a higher risk of developing heart problems. Researchers found a link between wake-up times and a person's cardiovascular condition. The study covered 3,017 healthy adults aged between 23 through 90. However, the study also noted that early risers were usually older.

Athletes often aren't counseled on the value of adequate sleep, researcher says. College students max out at five or six hours of sleep a night. Study followed six Stanford basketball players, ages 18 to 21, during their 2006 playing season. Sprint times improved by a second by the end of the study.

Sleep deprivation can lead to headaches, irritability, impaired concentration. Little is known about the consequences of the prescriptions children are being given. Many factors that impair sleep in adults such as obesity are at work in kids. Only 20 percent of adolescents get the recommended nine hours of sleep.

Napping is a powerful, very inexpensive way of improving our work, study says. Nearly four in 10 American workers admit napping on the job. Sleep-deprived teens crash just about anywhere because they're nocturnal. Women are especially prone to burnout from lack of sleep.

A single night of sleep deprivation can limit the consolidation of memory the next day. Sleep-deprived subjects performed significantly worse on memory tests than those who had slept well. Brain scans showed less activity in the area of the hippocampus that is key to remembering an event or episode. There are natural variations in the amount of sleep each person needs.

Lack of sleep causes the body to burn calories less efficiently, study finds. Study: Sleep deprivation can have serious effects on physical and mental health. Most experts recommend seven to nine hours of sleep a night for adults. Naps that are too long or taken too late in the day affect the quality of nighttime sleep.

Doctors rarely note the sleep problems of older patients, according to a new study. Researchers at the U.S. Northwestern University studied 1,503 patients aged 60 and older. They found that 69 percent of the patients had at least one sleep complaint. Previous research has linked sleep disorders in the elderly to poorer mental and physical health.

Sleep loss or disturbed sleep can heighten the risk for adolescents to take up smoking and drinking. Study based a questionnaire survey among 1, 362 adolescents, with an average age of 14.6 years. The amount of sleep a person gets affects physical health, emotional well-being, mental abilities.

A new study by British researchers reveals that women's health is much more at risk from sleep deprivation than men's. The study involved 5,766 volunteers (4,199 men and 1,567 women) from 20 London-based civil service departments. The researchers looked at men and women sleeping less than or equal to 5 hours a night to see if their risk of developing hypertension was any higher.



Charles Taylor's family says his lawyers have threatened to withdraw from the case. They claim a lack of time and resources means a fair trial is impossible. Taylor is accused of aiding rebel groups which murdered, enslaved and mutilated civilians. He faces a total of 11 charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights.

Lawyers for former Liberian president Charles Taylor demand more time to construct his defence. The trial of the ex-warlord, the biggest case before the International Criminal Court, has already been delayed once. Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003.

Members of an international tribunal for Sierra Leone arrived in Liberia on a fact-finding mission ahead of the trial of Charles Taylor. Taylor goes on trial on June 4 at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003 which left around 400,000 people dead.

Former Liberian president Charles Taylor is due to go on trial for war crimes next month. The trial, which was moved to The Hague to the premises of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for security reasons is set to start in June. Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003.

Charles Taylor's war crimes trial is set to start Monday. The former Liberian leader will be tried in The Hague by a special chamber of the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone. In the run-up to the trial Taylor's lawyers had complained that there were insufficient resources for the defence.

Charles Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He faces a life sentence if convicted. The charges stem from his alleged backing of Sierra Leonean rebels, who mutilated, raped and enslaved their victims. Taylor was flown to the Netherlands in June last year amid fears that staging his trial in Sierra Leone could trigger unrest.

Charles Taylor's lawyer says he will not be ready for the start of his trial in June. Judge Teresa Doherty makes it clear the June 4 start date will not change. Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He faces a life sentence if convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.

Charles Taylor is charged with overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement. The Special Court for Sierra Leone has raised about half of its $33 million budget for 2007. The trial is expected to start June 4 in The Hague, Netherlands. Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Charles Taylor is accused of orchestrating war crimes in Sierra Leone while he was leader of Liberia. Lead defense lawyer Karim Khan had asked for the trial to be postponed because consultations with his client were interrupted. Khan stopped meeting Taylor after authorities at the detention block installed video surveillance cameras in the room where the lawyers and Taylor discussed the case.

Charles Taylor's lawyer says potential witnesses are afraid of U.N. sanctions. Taylor is to go on trial June 4 on 11 charges, including terrorism, murder and rape. The former Liberian president is accused of supporting rebels in Sierra Leone's civil war. He has pleaded innocent and faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.



A high blood level of vitamin D could help reduce the risk of breast cancer by half. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in food and is made in the body. US health authorities have not established a recommended daily allowance for the vitamin. sunlight's UV rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin.

Vitamin D cut the risk of several types of cancer by 60 percent overall for older women. Study was designed mainly to monitor how calcium and vitamin D improve bone health. Number of cancer cases overall was small, showing up in just 50 patients. Vitamin D helps regulate cell growth, a fundamental biological process that goes haywire in cancer.

The American Cancer Society favors keeping current vitamin D guidelines of 200 to 600 international units daily. Dr. Michael Thun now says he misunderstood a reporter's question and holds no position on whether those amounts should be changed. He also said he thinks it's too early to recommend using vitamin D to prevent cancer.

Colorectal cancer seems to occur more often among those who live in sunshine-deprived areas. Some people theorize that the lack of vitamin D may play a role in the disease. People with a 25(OH)D blood level of 33 nanograms per milliliter or higher were 50 percent less likely to have developed colorectals.

"Vitamin D deficiency is very common," says an endocrinologist. Vitamin D is key to the absorption of calcium. It's of particular concern among post-menopausal women and those with osteoporosis. The best food sources of vitamin D aren't necessarily the foods we love.

Vitamin D intake associated with lower death rates from a variety of causes. Light from the sun converts a chemical in our skin into vitamin D. Vitamin is needed for strong bones and to regulate cell growth. Milk is not a natural source of the vitamin, but most dairies fortify milk with it.

Study: Individuals with the highest blood levels of 25(OH)D had the lowest risk of breast cancer. Study: High serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained. Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements and exposure of the skin to ultraviolet B (UVB)

Canada's Cancer Society urges people to increase vitamin D intake. Adults living in Canada should consider taking 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day. Older people, those with darker skin, not going outside often or wearing clothing that covers most skin should consider the supplement year round.

Adequate intake of vitamin D may help prevent cancer, according to a new study. 600,000 cases a year of breast and colorectal cancer could be prevented each year if vitamin D3 levels met the target proposed by researchers. Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements and exposure of the skin to sunlight.

Study: Women with high sun exposure had half the risk of developing advanced breast cancer. These findings were observed only for women with naturally light skin color. Skin color is an important factor that determines how much vitamin D is produced in the body. Women should not try to reduce their risk of breast cancer by sunbathing because of sun-induced skin cancer.



Fishermen and search and rescue teams have thus far found around 200 survivors. The ill-fated ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang. Officials said they lost contact with the vessel around midnight (1700 GMT) Friday.

Ships and rescue teams scour rough seas off Indonesia for hundreds still missing. More than 200 survivors have been found since the ferry sank late Friday with some 600 on board. Health department officials have brought in hundreds of body bags in preparation for the worst. The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank.

More than 200 survivors have been found since the ferry sank late Friday with some 600 people on board. The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank. Survivors say the ship went down in minutes in rough seas as it tried to stabilise itself, leaving the passengers and crew little chance of saving themselves.

More than 200 survivors have been found since the ferry sank late Friday with some 600 people on board. Three unidentified victims were buried Wednesday in Rembang, east of Semarang. Survivors have been spotted on liferafts but bad weather and huge waves have been hampering efforts to pluck them to safety.

"Dead or alive, I will accept his destiny. It is up to God. All I can do is keep waiting," father says. Eleven survivors and two corpses arrive at Rembang port on Java's northern coast. The Senopati Nusantara went down before midnight Friday after being pounded by heavy waves.

"Dead or alive, I will accept his destiny. It is up to God. All I can do is keep waiting," a father says. More than 150 people have been found alive, either packed into lifeboats or on beaches. The Senopati Nusantara sank quickly after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours.

Weeping relatives camped out at a local hospital are becoming more desperate. Transport minister says nearly 200 people have been found alive. The Senopati Nusantara sank after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urges rescue teams to keep up the hunt.

Rescuers refuse to give up hope with survivors still being found in life-rafts. A temporary morgue is being set up at a port close to where the passenger ship went down. Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa said Monday nearly 200 had been found alive.

Nearly 200 people have been found alive so far. The Senopati Nusantara sank after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours. High winds and poor visibility have prevented helicopters and search planes from taking to the air. The ferry, built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of 850 people.

Dozens of survivors who drifted at sea for three days were picked up by fishing boats. Strong winds and poor visibility prevented search aircraft from taking to the skies. Rescue teams are focused around Madura island, around 600 kilometers east of Jakarta. Nearly 200 have been found alive since the ferry sinking and authorities say they will keep searching until Sunday.



The Slow Loris is a small furry nocturnal primate from south and southeast Asia. It is threatened by the destruction of its forest habitat and growing demand for traditional medicine and as a pet. The requests also include an attempt by the United States to control the trade in pink coral for the first time.

10 percent of Caribbean's 62 spectacular reef-building corals are under threat. Coral reefs support some of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. In some well-managed, protected areas of the ocean, human impacts are reduced, allowing most corals to thrive.

Red corals are among the world's most expensive wildlife commodities. Destructive fishing methods and over-harvesting have reduced worldwide catches by 90 percent. All 26 species in the Corallium genus will now be protected by the 171-nation Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species.

UN wildlife trade organisation removes restrictions on global trade in coral species. Coral species severely depleted by commercial exploitation. Destructive fishing methods and over-harvesting have reduced worldwide catches. A finished necklace of red coral retails for up to 20,000 dollars (15,000 euros)

U.S. is leading a push to have the coral protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Fishers and craftsmen of Torre del Greco have harvested the coral for generations. Raw coral can sell for US$900 (euro670) per kilogram at auction. Finished works of art or pieces of jewelry can cost anywhere from US$20,000 (euro15,000)

Red coral is a slow-growing deep-sea coral that grows all over the world. It is harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and parts of the Pacific. In the Mediterranean, it is gathered by scuba divers but fishermen still use trawl nets. Raw coral can sell for US$900 (euro670) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) at auction.

84 percent of the United States' coral reefs are located along Florida's coastline. Pollution, warming waters, commercial fishing, development and ship groundings are jeopardizing them. Florida is managing underwater nurseries to grow coral that will be transplanted onto natural reefs. Scientists warn that up to half of the world's coral reefs could disappear by 2045.

Scientists have nursed dozens of tiny coral fragments in a lab in Ruskin. They have transported them to Western Sambo Reef in the Keys. It's all part of a complicated experiment to find a new way to save Florida's vast coral reefs. Two species of coral last year were listed as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act.

Coral reefs in the Florida Keys are suffering the kinds of environmental disruption that afflict corals around the world. Many would say corals globally are already so damaged, and so threatened by further environmental degradation, that there is little chance restoration efforts can turn things around. The World Bank has embarked on a global program to assess restoration efforts.

Coral reefs are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems. The annual economic value of coral reefs to world tourism is $9.6 billion. The Mesoamerican Reef is seriously endangered by coastal development, runoff, and pollution. Crucial partnerships between conservation groups and the tourism industry have also taken root in the Coral Triangle.



Seventeen Chinese nationals in a wildlife poaching outfit have been caught with 240 protected turtles, most of them dead. Only 20 of the 240 Hawksbill and Green turtles were found alive after marine police arrested the poachers, from southern Hainan province. The World Conservation lists the Hawksbill turtle as critically endangered, while the Green turtle is also endangered.

Malaysian court jails 17 Chinese fishermen for 18 months each for poaching hundreds of protected turtles. The poachers were caught by Malaysian marine police on March 28 in waters off the coast of eastern Sabah state. The catch of 274 protected Hawksbill and Green turtles, only 32 of which were still alive. The World Conservation Union lists the Hawksbill turtle as critically endangered.

13 Chinese fishermen jailed for 18 months each for poaching nearly 80 protected turtles. They are the second group of fishermen from China's Hainan island jailed this week for turtle poaching. 17 men sentenced on Wednesday for catching 274 of the creatures. China is a major importer of turtles from Asia for food and medicinal purposes.

Thai villagers catch a river terrapin turtle that was thought to be extinct in the country. The female turtle was found Jan. 3 in a mangrove canal in Phang Nga province on the country's Andaman coast. It was the first time the turtle species was found in Thailand in two decades, the WWF said. The turtles have seen their numbers reduced drastically in recent years.

A team of four scientists has launched an investigation into the deaths of the olive ridley turtles. At least 65 of the sea turtles have been found dead along a five-kilometer stretch of beach. There is no clear total of exactly how many turtles have died. Olive ridleys, the smallest of all sea turtles, are endangered.

Nearly 90 sea turtles rescued after a cold snap left them comatose have been returned to the Gulf of Mexico. At least 130 of the cold-blooded animals were rescued after being stunned by a rapid temperature drop in mid-January. With the water temperature in the 50s Fahrenheit (around 10 Celsius), the turtles' systems began shutting down.

Malaysian authorities seize a second Chinese trawler allegedly poaching endangered turtles. Marine police on Wednesday stopped a fishing boat near the coast of Malaysia's eastern Sabah state. They found more than 200 protected green and hawksbill turtle species on board. Only about 20 of the turtles were still alive, the newspapers said.

A court in eastern Malaysia has jailed 17 Chinese fishermen for 1 1/2 years each. They failed to pay fines for poaching almost 300 protected turtles in Malaysian waters. The same court also jailed nine Vietnamese fishermen for six months each for illegally fishing. Turtles are poached for their shells to be made into decorative items, and for their meat.

Zoo Atlanta is the only facility in the world successfully breeding the Arakan forest turtle. The species, native to Myanmar, is on the list of the world's most critically endangered species. The turtles were believed to be extinct for close to a century, but turned up in Asian food markets in the mid-1990s.

Three species of turtle lay their eggs on the contiguous beaches of Litibu, Malinal, Punta Negra and Careyeros. Poachers steal the eggs for their alleged aphrodisiac effects, gulping them raw with lime and chili. Poached eggs can fetch as much as 10 pesos apiece, says Gilberto Galindo Castro.



A blazing car crashed into the terminal building at Glasgow Airport in Scotland on Saturday, police said. Witness James Edgar said there was "absolute chaos" at the airport. The incident came just a day after police foiled car bomb attacks in London. The fire is now out, police say.

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirms incident in which a jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack" Brown justified raising the security threat level to "critical" Brown: The incident was an "attack" and justifies raising the threat level.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirms that a blazing jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack" He justified raising the security threat level to "critical" Brown praised the emergency services for their response to foiling two car bomb attacks in London Friday.

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirms that a jeep rammed into a terminal at Scotland's Glasgow airport was "an attack" He justified raising the security threat level to "critical" Brown praised the emergency services for their response to foiling two car bomb attacks in London Friday and "now today the attack"

The threat level is set at "critical," meaning that a further attack is considered imminent. One of the attackers was set ablaze from head to foot, an eyewitness says. The airport in Liverpool has also been closed until further notice. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says there are no plans to raise the threat level.

Two people are arrested in connection with the events in London and Scotland, police say. Britain's threat level is now at "critical," meaning that another attack is considered imminent. The threat has not been as high since last year, after authorities discovered a plot to attack airliners.

Britain's national security alert level has been raised to "critical," the highest rating. This means imminent attack is expected. The Home Office has also ordered security to be tightened. A burning car was driven at the front of the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport. Two people were arrested and the airport was evacuated.

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown urges the public to remain vigilant and support the police. The national security alert level was raised to "critical" on Saturday night. A burning car was driven at the front of the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport, at around 3:15 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.

The two suspects were arrested in the county of Cheshire by counter-terrorism officers. Glasgow Airport was evacuated and closed after a burning car crashed into the main terminal building. On Friday, police foiled a car bomb plot in central London after they discovered explosives packed into a car.

The two suspects were arrested in the county of Cheshire by counter-terrorism officers. A burning Jeep Cherokee crashed into the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport on Saturday. On Friday, police foiled a car bomb plot in central London. Britain's Home Office has also ordered security to be tightened across the country.



Twenty-two women who took part in recent trials for a gel designed to prevent HIV infection have contracted the virus. World Health Organisation last week announced that two out of six advanced trials of the vaginal microbicides gels had been stopped for safety reasons. Researchers testing cellulose sulphate found that women who used the gel ran a higher risk of HIV infection.

Trials show that male circumcision more than halves the risk of HIV infection. Men who were uncircumcised were twice as likely to catch the human immunodeficiency virus. The data were so dramatic that the trials in Kenya and Uganda were halted ahead of schedule. The theory behind circumcision's protective effect is that the foreskin has a very thin epithelium.

The studies were testing Ushercell, a gel containing cellulose sulfate. More than half of all new infections with the AIDS virus in Africa involve women and girls. Scientists have long sought a method of protection women could use, even without their partners' knowledge. Another study of a different microbicide, Carraguard, is due to wrap up in March.

Women who took valacyclovir had less HIV in their blood and in their genital secretions. The study did not look at whether the drug reduces transmission of the AIDS virus. Doctors have been looking for novel ways to treat and prevent HIV infection. There are 40,000 new HIV infections in the U.S. each year and 4.3 million new cases worldwide.

Scientists: Circumcision reduces men's chances of catching HIV by up to 60 percent. World Health Organization official: "This is the most potent intervention in HIV prevention" Study projects that in the next decade, male circumcision could prevent 2 million infections and 300,000 deaths. Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa became infected with HIV.

Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa became infected with HIV, and 2.1 million people died. The region is home to over 60 percent of all people living with HIV. Africa also struggles with high rates of tuberculosis and malaria infection. "We should go back to the basics: that primary health care is what Africa needs," commissioner says.

Outbreak began in KwaZulu-Natal province last year and is found throughout the country. XDR tuberculosis is resistant to many drugs, although it can be treated with four antibiotics. Since 1993, there have been 47 cases in the U.S., resulting in 13 deaths.

Study: 31 percent of HIV-positive patients in Uganda found to have HIV dementia. HIV dementia is treatable and potentially reversible with antiretroviral medication. Treatment can restore completely normal cognitive function to some of those affected. Of the estimated 40 million adults and children living with HIV infection, an estimated 27 million live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Malawi has started a process of formulating a law that will protect people from deliberate and malicious infection of HIV. "The government is just responding to the needs of the people who have been calling for such a law for a very long time," Mary Shawa, principal secretary for HIV/AIDS and nutrition in the president's office said.

A study carried out by British researchers has revealed that a drug designed to combat genital herpes can reduce levels of HIV in the blood by 70 percent. Researchers of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, had the findings after having carried out a small trial in Africa. Researchers believe that valacyclovir indirectly reduces HIV infection by decreasing copies of the herpes virus and note that untreated herpes can cause lesions in the genital region.



Bernard Madoff allegedly duped some of the world's smartest investors, reports suggest. Evidence emerged that Madoff's alleged multi-billion-dollar fraud stretched from Tokyo to Europe. Prosecutors allege Madoff confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars in the so-called Ponzi scheme.

Santander says its investment fund subsidiary may have lost more than three billion dollars. French bank BNP Paribas also revealed it could lose up to 350 million euros (470 million dollars) Royal Bank of Scotland said it had "some exposure" to Madoff, but declined to give details.

Bernard Madoff is alleged to have lost 50 billion dollars in a giant pyramid scheme. Italy's stock market watchdog has launched an investigation into the impact of the scandal on the national financial system. A British investment fund that also acknowledged being a Madoff client criticised what it called the "systemic failure" of US regulators.

Bramdean Alternatives Limited invested around 21 million pounds (23.3 million euros, 31.2 million dollars) with Madoff's company. Madoff was arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding his customers through a giant pyramid scheme. Several British newspapers reported that among Bramdean's clients is property magnate Vincent Tchenguiz.

Bernard L. Madoff, accused in $50 billion fraud, freed on $10 million bail. Lawyer says Madoff will "fight to get through this unfortunate event" Judge puts temporary hold on some assets of firm until court-appointed receiver can take control. One investor says he and a friend may have lost millions of dollars.

Reichmuth &amp; Co says it has 385 million Swiss francs ($327 million) at risk. Amount represents about 3.5 percent of the 11 billion francs under the bank's management. Second private Swiss bank to acknowledge having investments in funds managed by Madoff.

Sen. Frank Lautenberg was an investor in Bernard Madoff's investment fund. The 70-year-old Madoff was arrested Thursday in what prosecutors say was a $50 billion scheme. Those who have acknowledged potential losses so far include former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman, New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon.

BNP Paribas says it has "no investment of its own" in Madoff's hedge funds. The bank says it "does have risk exposure to these funds through its trading business" Madoff was detained Thursday in what prosecutors say was a $50 billion scheme to defraud investors.

Bernard L. Madoff's firm "is cooperating fully with the government," his attorney says. Lawyer: Madoff lured investors with "substantial sums of money" Madoff is charged with stealing as much as $50 billion, in part to cover a pattern of losses. The returns paid to investors came from money invested by others.

The tally of reported losses climbed through the weekend to nearly $20 billion. Some of the biggest losers were members of the Palm Beach Country Club. So far, only Madoff, the firm's founder, has been arrested in the scandal. Scrutiny is falling on the many banks and money managers who helped steer clients to Madoff.



China plans to cut its average water consumption by 20 percent by the end of 2010. Double-digit economic growth and a growing population are putting a heavy strain on China's limited water resources. China only recycles 60 to 65 percent of its industrial water, compared with 80 to 85 percent in developed countries.

China increased its grain production 2.8 percent to 497.46 million tonnes in 2006. The world's most populous nation still faces the prospect of shortages. China faces the possibility of a 48 million tonne grain shortage in 2010. The nation of 1.3 billion people needs to feed its growing population.

China is expected to surpass the United States as the world's No. 1 greenhouse gas emitter in the next decade. It wants to reduce its dependence on coal but converting to cleaner energies on a mass scale would be prohibitively costly. It also "lags behind Europe and the U.S" in the technology needed to burn cleaner coal, Qin Dahe says.

Average temperature in China has risen by 0.5 to 0.8 degree centigrade in the past century. China's output of major crops could fall by up to 37 percent in the second half of this century if no effective measures are taken. Most areas in China, especially northern areas, will get drier.

Yangtze water levels hit a record low in 2006, while its tributaries dropped 30 to 60 percent below average levels. The flow at Yichang City, where the Three Gorges dam is located, was 64 percent of the average, the lowest since 1877 when records began.

The Three Gorges Dam in central China's Hubei Province has opened its floodgates to ease the severe water shortages along the Yangtze River. The world's largest hydropower project has been releasing bigger quantities of water since late December. The company said the dam could release an additional 6.1 billion cubic meters of water by reducing the reservoir's water level.

China's Yangtze River is experiencing the worst water shortage in more than a century. Water in the upper reaches decreased by over 60 percent from the previous year. Low water levels in the river have made it impossible for some fish species to migrate back to the sea.

The number of migratory birds in Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, has dropped by 40 percent. The lake's water level has been falling continuously since last July as it supplies water to the drought-stricken Yangtze River. The water shortage will not be alleviated until March.

Shandong Province will invest 3.6 billion yuan over the next four years to build 21 sea water desalination plants. Qingdao, Yantai, Binzhou and a few other cities will benefit from the project. China is among the driest countries in the world, and 400 out of 600 Chinese cities suffer from water shortages.

At least 1 million people in Chongqing Municipality with water shortages. Water levels in the Yangtze and Jialing rivers have declined sharply in recent weeks. It follows last summer's severe drought that forced tens of thousands of farmers to eke out a living away from home. Sources with the China Three Gorges Project Corporation say water shortage in upper reaches had not affected the world's largest water storage facility.



The accident happened on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue at about 2:20 p.m. A piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding the crane to the building. The crane split into pieces as it fell. Part of it came to rest against an apartment tower.

A crane mounted to the side of a skyscraper under construction toppled with a roar. The crane split into pieces as it fell, pulverizing one small, brick apartment building. An intensive, but delicate rescue operation was under way to find anyone still trapped. "It was an absolute freak accident," an owner of the company that manages the construction site says.

"It's a horrible situation, very gory. There's blood in the street," Lt. Gov. David Paterson says. The collapse created a virtual war zone on an affluent block on Manhattan's East Side. One man was pulled from a collapsed townhouse 3 1/2 hours after the building was crushed.

Rescue crews work through the night into Sunday morning sifting through piles of rubble. Mayor Michael Bloomberg says at least 10 people were injured in what he called one of New York City's worst construction accidents. The crane split into pieces as it fell Saturday afternoon, pulverizing a four-story town house and demolishing parts of five other buildings.

"It's a horrible situation, very gory. There's blood in the street," says Lt. Gov. David Paterson. The four dead are all believed to be construction workers on a new high-rise condo building. At least 17 others were injured in what Mayor Michael Bloomberg called one of the city's worst construction accidents. The collapse devastated the affluent block on Manhattan's East Side.

Three people still listed as missing as rescue teams pick through rubble of town house. Mayor Michael Bloomberg calls the collapse one of the city's worst construction accidents. Twenty-four others were injured, including 11 first responders, Bloomberg says. The fallen crane had stood at least 19 stories high and was attached to a half-built apartment tower.

Four construction workers killed, 14 injured in Midtown Manhattan crane collapse. Mayor Michael Bloomberg calls it one of the city's worst construction accidents ever. The crane, reaching 19 stories tall, collapsed during construction of a 43-story building. The top section of the crane crushed a four-story townhouse when it fell.

"It was an absolute freak accident," crane owner says. The crane was in the process of "jumping" when it fell, officials say. The construction site has been cited 13 times for violations since January 2006. "It's very gory, there is blood in the street," incoming governor says.

"If that thing would fall over, my building would be toast," a neighbor says. "I don't think you should be more worried about any crane," says Jarrod Shandley, 25. About 250 cranes are in operation in the five boroughs, officials say.

NEW: Fire commissioner: "Things are getting more grim" Four construction workers and three riggers were killed, three are missing. The crane's tower had reached a height of more than 200 feet, or about 20 stories. Officials are focusing their investigation in part on the way a "collar" was being installed.



Lawmakers of the Duma lower house of parliament voted unanimously in favour of the text. Local hospitals, which take in the majority of ill people, can not remove organs. Organ trafficking has become a problem over the past few years in Russia. In 2005 four Russian doctors, who stood accused of trying to remove the kidneys of someone who was still alive, were acquitted.

China's military is reportedly harvesting organs from prison inmates, mostly Falungong practitioners. Canada's former Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific region David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas released a report Wednesday. They also interviewed Canadian hospital staff who subsequently cared for hundreds of patients after they underwent dubious transplant surgeries in China. China banned the spiritual group in 1999 and has vehemently denied the allegations.

At present there are no specific rules on organ donation to foreigners. Much of the trade in human organs, especially kidneys, takes place on the black market. A study found that in one slum area in Manila, there were 3,000 men and women who had sold one of their kidneys.

U.S. transplant network says youngsters may be candidates for an incompatible heart up to age 2. It is the first step in a new push by the United Network for Organ Sharing. Implant a mismatched heart in an adult, and he or she will die rapidly. But babies' immune systems must learn to recognize and attack an organ of a different blood type.

Lawmakers want legal advice before acting on a bill that would shave up to 180 days off a prison sentence for inmates who donate. South Carolina advocates for organ donations say the incentive policy would be the first of its kind in the nation. Federal law makes it illegal to give organ donors "valuable consideration"

UC doctors will care for Kaiser's kidney transplant patients before, during and after surgeries. Kaiser had been caring for about 1,500 patients who had already received transplants. Since May, nearly 2,000 Kaiser patients awaiting transplants have been transferred. Fewer than 40 remain to be shifted.

Dr. Hootan Roozrokh was a surgeon at Kaiser's now-defunct kidney transplant program. At issue is whether he ordered excessive doses of powerful pain medication. Ruben Navarro, 25, was on life support and near death when he was found unresponsive.

Frida Ghitis: Seattle woman's partner was killed in Dec. 14 flood; she testified for domestic partnership bill. She says she was denied access to Kate Fleming, who was unable to speak to her wishes. Ghitis says she's had to make tough decisions about life-support systems, organ donations. She asks: What if she dies without knowing I told her I loved her, or took off her wedding ring?

Zimbabwe could soon revive its human organ donation program. Health and Child Welfare Deputy Minister Edwin Muguti said strong regulatory measures would be put in place to ensure the success of the program. Currently, patients that require human organ donations have to go abroad as Zimbabwe does not have adequate and proper resources.

China is faced with a huge gap between the patients who need functional organs and limited donations. About 1.5 million patients need organ transplant each year, but only 10,000 can find organs for transplant. Most organs were donated by ordinary citizens upon their death after the voluntary signing of donation agreements.



Pirates seize Saudi-owned super tanker Sirius Star off the east coast of Africa. The 318,000 deadweight tonnes Very Large Crude Carrier is the largest vessel to be seized in an epidemic of piracy in the region. Sirius Star, which is owned by Saudi Aramco, carried 25 crew members from Croatia, Britain, Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.

NATO has four ships -- from Britain, Greece, Italy and Turkey -- on patrol in the waters off Somalia. The mission, NATO's first-ever against pirates, ends in mid-December. NATO played no role in response to the seizure of the oil-laden Saudi tanker, the Sirius Star, at the weekend.

U.S. Navy: Somali pirates hijack a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast. The tanker, owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is 330 meters (1,080 feet) long. The 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.

Hijacking points to widening ambitions and capabilities among pirates. It is the largest ship pirates have seized, and the farthest out to sea they have successfully struck. The tanker is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco. The Sirius Star was attacked more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya.

Pirates hijack a Saudi supertanker hundreds of miles out in the Indian Ocean. It is the largest vessel seized yet in a surge of pirate attacks. It's the farthest out to sea that the well-armed fighters have successfully struck. The attack is an alarming sign of the difficulty of patrolling a vast stretch of ocean.

The MV Sirius Star, a brand new tanker with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 a.m. Saturday. It was seized more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the U.S. Navy says. Never before have they seized such a giant ship so far out to sea. Pirates have been spreading attacks southward into a vast area of the Indian Ocean that is difficult and costly to patrol.

The U.S. Navy says the MV Sirius Star was seized off the coast of Kenya on Saturday. Vela International Marine Ltd. says the 25 crew are safe and that the ship is fully loaded with crude. Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year. The Saudi tanker was the largest ship taken.

Saudi oil supertanker hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend. Owner says 25 crew members are safe and the ship is fully loaded with crude. U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday. Somali pirates have become bolder, better armed and capable of operating hundreds of miles away.

The 1,080-foot-long ship is the largest ship known to have been seized by pirates. It was fully loaded with 2 million barrels of oil. The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, called the hijacking "an outrageous act" This year, 92 ships have been attacked in and around the Gulf of Aden.

Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker. Tanker is the largest vessel ever seized, loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members. Reports from the U.S. Navy said the tanker, Sirius Star, was hijacked after a group of pirates managed to scale the 10-meter high side of the ship.



Major rivers burst their banks and inundated low areas in the north of the country. The military has begun to evacuate people and distribute relief. Unconfirmed reports say at least 10 people have so far died of drowning and snake-bites. Bangladesh is criss-crossed by a network of 230 rivers and suffers annual floods.

Millions of people have fled their homes in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Death toll in the past week from floods triggered by heavy monsoon rains topped 100. More than 22 people have died in Nepal, 13 others lost their lives in Bangladesh. Indian air force helicopters were on stand-by to deliver food and other essentials.

Flash floods caused by monsoon rains and glacial snowmelt inundate large swathes of northern Bangladesh. At least 675,000 villagers forced to move to temporary shelters or seek higher ground as rivers burst their banks. Bangladesh is criss-crossed by a network of 230 rivers and suffers annual floods.

Floods in Bangladesh have killed at least 38 people and left 4.5 million others displaced or marooned in their homes. Major rivers fed by monsoon rains and snowmelt burst their banks, inundating more than half of the country's 64 districts. Television footage showed people perched on rooftops or using banana trees as rafts to escape submerged villages.

More than a third of Bangladesh has been inundated by floods, the Food and Disaster Management Ministry says. At least 5 million people have either been marooned or displaced in the country's hardest-hit northern region. The River Jamuna breached its banks this week, inundating much of Sirajganj.

At least eight people died in floodwater or in flood-related incidents like snakebite in three northern districts of Kurigram, Mymensingh and Netrakona on Sunday. Almost 1 million people were marooned by floodwater in about 10 districts in northern, northeastern and central parts of the country. Floodwater triggered by incessant monsoon rains have destroyed houses and submerged paddy fields.

Five people drowned in floodwaters in northwestern Sirajganj district, two in northern Jamalpur district and one in northern Sherpur district. At least eight people died in floodwater or flood-related incidents in three northern districts on Sunday. About 1 million people were marooned by floodwater in about ten districts in northern, northeastern and central parts of the country.

Four of the victims drowned in northeastern Sirajganj district, 110 km northeast of Dhaka, while two in northern Gaibandha district. Officials said standing crops on 5,300 acres of land were damaged by the floodwaters. Bus and railway services, gas supply in some more flood- affected areas have been suspended.

So far 38 people have died in flood-related incidents, Bangladesh Food and Digester Management Adviser Tapan Chowdhury said. Official statistics say the floodwaters affected more than 4.5 million people in 36 districts out of the country's 64 districts. Reports of local media said northern Sirajganj town, one of the worst-hit by flood, is now under 90 cm of water.

The UK has given 2.5 million U.S. dollars of immediate aid for the flood victims. The aid money will be spent for providing food, water, shelter and medicines for 50,000 people in the ten worst-affected districts. The UK's Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting the Bangladesh government's ongoing relief work. So far, at least 38 people have been killed and over 4.5million affected by the current flood.



China is forcing nomadic Tibetan herders to settle in towns to clear land for development. Herders have been forced to slaughter herds of yaks, sheep and goats, Human Rights Watch says. Communist officials have paid minimal compensation and failed to protect Tibetans' legal rights, it says.

Over-farming has drawn down the water table so low that desert is overtaking farmland. Authorities have ordered farmers here in Gansu province to vacate their properties. The relocation program is part of a larger plan to rein in China's expanding deserts. China has less than 7 percent of the world's arable land with which to feed 1.3 billion people.

Worsening stone desertification is threatening the survival of about 450,000 farmers in southwest China's Guizhou Province. About one fifth of the province's land area -- 35,920 square kilometers -- is afflicted by karst rocky desertification. As the soil erodes, survival for local farmers becomes increasingly precarious. At the current rate at which damaged areas are being recovered -- 1,000 square kilometers per year -- Guiz Zhou would need at least 70 years to bring soil erosion under control.

This year's first sandstorm hit Minqin County of northwest China's Gansu Province on Friday. The sandstorm started at 11:28 a.m., with a minimum visibility of 600 meters, and died down an hour later. The county suffered only 14 sandstorms last year, compared with around 26 on average.

It's the fourth consecutive year the so-called No. 1 Document has targeted agriculture and issues concerning the countryside. China will encourage its farmers to use more environmentally-friendly fertilizers and pesticides. Local governments have been ordered to restrict the amount of arable land that is lost to urban growth.

Eleven to 15 sand storms are expected to hit China this spring. This is about the same as last year when the country experienced 14 sand storms. The State Forestry Administration has called together a team of 25 experts. The SFA is also investing heavily in setting up a monitoring network.

China has reversed soil erosion over an area of 960,000 square kilometers, or 10 percent of its total land area. Soil conservation efforts have helped increase grain production by 18 billion kilograms a year. Since 2001, China has spent billions of yuan planting trees, converting marginal farmland to forest and grasslands.

China has about 21.3 million hectares of hillside farmland, about 18 percent of the total. About 40 to 60 kilograms of soil lost in producing a kilogram of grain on slopes on the northern Loess Plateau. The ministry has banned farming and forestry projects on all hillsides at an incline above 25 degrees.

Erosion could wipe away more than 61,600 square kilometers of land by 2010. Figure represents an increase of 11.5 percent from the amount lost from 2001 to 2005. E said situation had deteriorated as the country stepped up urbanization and industrialization. Erosion made the land less fertile or turned the soil into sand.

Soil erosion is deteriorating in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Excessive herding and farming have outpaced the government's conservation efforts. At least 12 million people are suffering the consequences, ranging from water shortages to cropland infertility. Xinjiang is blamed for nearly 30 percent of China's total acreage of soil erosion.



Seven near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur. One of the explosions went off near a packed Hindu temple, leaving pools of blood outside in the street. One live bomb was found attached to a bicycle at one of the explosion sites and was defused.

Miliband: "There can never be any justification for acts of indiscriminate violence such as these" Seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other, tearing apart markets in Jaipur. British Foreign Secretary: Britain "stands and will continue to stand with the government and people of India against terrorism"

French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner expresses revulsion at bomb blasts in Jaipur. "I wish to express my indignation and repugnance at the wave of attacks," he says. "France is more than ever willing to intensify cooperation with India in the anti-terrorist struggle," he adds.

At least five bombs hit markets in Jaipur, the capital of the western desert state of Rajasthan. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm. One of the blasts took place near a temple, where cycles and rickshaws lay in a mangled heap.

Police arrest two men after eight near-simultaneous bombings in Jaipur. Seven women and 10 children are among the dead, the state's chief minister says. The blasts went off within minutes of each other close to several Hindu temples. Schools and government offices shut in a day of mourning across the desert state.

A hospital official says at least 45 people have been killed in six bomb blasts. Another 100 people have reportedly been wounded in Tuesday's attacks. A seventh bomb was defused before it exploded, a police official says. Jaipur is located in a region dotted with palaces and ancient cities.

"Obviously, it's a terrorist plot," says police chief of Rajasthan state. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, as is the case with most bombings in India. Authorities put New Delhi and Mumbai on high alert. The blasts hit a jewelry market, on the steps of a Hindu monkey god temple and elsewhere.

Seven bombs ripped through the city of Jaipur, leaving at least 60 people dead. "The United States stands with the government and people of India in their ongoing fight to eliminate the scourge terrorism," a State Department spokesman says. He says there is no justification for such killings.

Seven bombs go off within minutes of one another in Jaipur, one of India's main tourist hubs. Reports of deaths range from 50 upward, with roughly 150 injured. There were no claims of responsibility, which is typical of terrorist attacks in India. The last major bombing in India was in August, killing more than 40.

Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the terrorist blasts. Serial blasts rocked crowded market areas and near a Hanuman temple in the walled tourist city. Rajasthan Director General of Police A. S. Gill said it was " obviously a terror attack"



OJ Simpson questioned by police over an alleged armed robbery at a casino hotel room. Simpson was later released without charge but is continuing to help police with their investigation. The alleged victim was identified by celebrity news website TMZ.com as sports memorabilia collector Alfred Beardsley. Simpson is the prime suspect in the brutal 1994 murders of estranged wife Nicole Brown-Simpson.

OJ Simpson arrested in connection with an armed robbery in Las Vegas, US television reports. Police arrested him in a continuing investigation over an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia. Simpson was the prime suspect in the 1994 murders of his estranged wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. He was acquitted of them after a racially charged trial in 1995.

O.J. Simpson has been charged with eight offences, including kidnapping and armed robbery. The former American football star is to appear in court in Las Vegas on Wednesday for an arraignment hearing. The charges stem from an incident at the Palace Station casino on Thursday. Simpson was the prime suspect in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman.

O.J. Simpson is expected to be questioned again Sunday and may face arrest, police say. The man detained Saturday night was arrested on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon. Simpson has said the items belonged to him, and police have questioned him once in their investigation.

O.J. Simpson is being held at Las Vegas police offices pending the arrival of his lawyer. The charges against Simpson will include robbery with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a firearm. At least one other person has been arrested and as many as six people could be arrested. Simpson has said there were no guns involved and that he went to the room at the casino only to get stolen mementos.

A judge sets bail at $125,000 (euro89,445) for O.J. Simpson in the alleged role in the armed robbery of sports memorabilia collectors at a Las Vegas hotel. Simpson, standing in a blue jail uniform and handcuffs, furrowed his brow as the judge read the list of charges against him. He did not enter a plea.

Charles Bruce Ehrlich was taken into custody in Las Vegas. Another defendant, Charles Cashmore, was arraigned minutes earlier. The men are accused of bursting into a hotel room last week displaying guns. According to police reports, the collectors were ordered at gunpoint to hand over items.

Charles Cashmore is accused of being one of five men who joined Simpson in a hotel-room confrontation. He will plead guilty to being an accessory to robbery, a felony that could get him up to five years in prison. Simpson and his co-defendants are accused of holding memorabilia dealers at gunpoint Sept. 13.

O.J. Simpson's co-defendant says he will plead guilty to accessory to robbery. Charles Cashmore can testify that guns were involved in the Sept. 13 confrontation. Simpson and his lawyers have denied guns were in the room. The case will go to trial in state court.

O. J. Simpson is charged with robbery with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary. He is accused of robbing a sports memorabilia collector at gunpoint in a Las Vegas casino. Simpson has said he was trying to retrieve stolen items that belonged to him, and denied the involvement of guns.



Recall involves 967,000 plastic preschool toys made by a Chinese vendor. Problem detected by an internal probe and reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall is the first for Fisher-Price Inc. and parent company Mattel Inc. involving lead paint. It is the largest for Mattel since 1998 when Fisher- price had to yank about 10 million Power Wheels.

Fisher-Price toys made in China with paint found to have excessive amounts of lead. Mattel shares fell 55 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $23.03 in afternoon trading Thursday. The company said it was reviewing the procedures of all of its manufacturing partners in China.

Fisher-Price recalls 83 types of toys because their paint contains excessive amounts of lead. The recall involves 967,000 plastic preschool toys made by a Chinese vendor. 80 percent of all toys are made in China. Industry experts are worried there will be more toy recalls to come.

Mattel recalls 1.5 million toys from China because they contain too much lead. Consumer Product Safety Commission largely relies on companies to report problems. About 80 percent of toys bought in the U.S. are made in China. About 60 percent of all product recalls this year have been for goods from China.

Mattel recalls nearly a million Fisher-Price toys because of possible lead paint contamination. Mattel says it was able to stop two-thirds of the 967,000 toys recalled in the U.S. Toys R Us says it did not know how many consumers bought the recalled toys.

 RC2 Corp. pulls a number of its Thomas &amp;amp; Friends trains and accessory parts. Red and yellow paint used to decorate more than 1.5 million of the toys contained lead. Lead, if ingested by children, can cause long-term neurological problems. The affected Thomas toys were manufactured in China.

Every one of the 24 toys recalled for safety reasons in the United States so far this year was manufactured in China. The latest recall, announced last week, involves 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and rail sets. China is responsible for about 60 percent of the overall product recalls, compared to 36 percent in 2000.

1.5 million wooden Thomas &amp;amp; Friends toys recalled because of lead paint. RC2 Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill., said the toys were made in China between 2005 and 2007. Toys could cause brain damage if ingested, company says. No reports of children becoming ill from toys.

RC2 fired both the vendor who made the lead paint and the company that made the wooden toys. The company has increased the number of times it checks incoming supplies and outgoing toys. About 40 percent of the 1.5 million toys that were recalled in June had been returned as of July 11.

Recall covers 86 different products, manufactured between April and July 6. Many of them feature "Sesame Street" and Nickelodeon characters. Mattel says it prevented more than two-thirds of the 967,000 affected toys from reaching consumers. This is Mattel's 17th recall in 10 years.
