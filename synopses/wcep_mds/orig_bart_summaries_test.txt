Archbishop Walmor Azevedo of Belo Horizonte is the new president of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil. The 65-year-old is responsible for keeping unity among the Brazilian bishops for the next four years. He says that only the light of the faith can restore the strength of the collegiality in the Brazilian Church.

US President Donald Trump said in a statement issued by the White House on Wednesday that the decision to recognize Brazil as a major non-NATO ally comes due to Brazil 's recent commitments to increase defense cooperation with the United States. Article 10 of The North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that the alliance 's members may only invite European states to accede to the treaty.

The NATO Council and Mediterranean Dialogue Partners Meeting took place in Ankara earlier this week. Turkey and the United States are experiencing tensions over the former 's plan to purchase the S-400 missile defense system from Russia and disagreements on Turkish drilling in the Eastern Mediterranean. The alliance could witness a further deepening of the current crisis if it fails to help two of its most powerful members overcome their issues.

US President Donald Trump announced the decision in a White House press release on Wednesday. As a non-NATO ally, Brazil would become a preferred buyer of US military equipment. Brazil would participate in Pentagon military auctions and participate in military exercises and training operations with US forces.

President Donald Trump has designated Brazil a major non-NATO ally. Brazil is the 18th nation to receive that label from the United States. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro will visit the U.S. next week. He was supposed to visit New York City to accept a Person of the Year award.

The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is headed to the region earlier than planned. The White House is expected to impose even more sanctions on Iran in the coming days. The situation has escalated swiftly since Trump designated Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization last month. The potential for Iranian retaliation in the region has put U.S. officials on edge.

The UK is being hijacked from within and without , simultaneously. The pretext for this dissolution of everything that holds the country together is the collusion between leading figures in the British Civil Service and figures in European Commission.

The new royal baby is named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. The royal couple made the announcement Wednesday via their official Instagram account. The announcement came with a black and white photo showing Queen Elizabeth II meeting her new grandson. Archie became seventh in line to the British throne the moment he was born.

Harry and Meghan welcomed a 7lb 3oz baby boy early on Monday morning. The couple will announce their first born 's godparents on the morning of his christening in a few months ' time. Royal infants usually have more than the standard three godparents. Prince Louis has six, future king Prince George has seven and Princess Charlotte has five.

Doria Ragland is said to have enrolled for grandparenting lessons with Brandi Jordan 's Cradle Company. The 40-year-old, who has three children, is married to a French 'wellness and spiritual coach' Doria is understood to have flown from her home in Los Angeles to Britain three weeks ago to be with Meghan during the final stages of her pregnancy.

Prince Harry announced the birth of his son to the world. He looked relaxed, happy and full of praise for his wife Meghan. As ever, Harry was polite, engaging and charming. He said nothing that he did not want to . Pressed on a name for his son, he pushed back gently. He told reporters all would be revealed in due course.

Harry and Meghan 's new baby is Earl of Dumbarton, which is the title granted to Harry by the Queen on the occasion of his wedding. Had he been a girl, she would have been Lady Baby Mountbatten-Windsor. The Queen issued a notice in 2012 that all the children of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style and attribute of Royal Highness.

Markle could not have a home birth after going overdue. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were hoping to have their baby at home on the grounds of Windsor Castle at Frogmore Cottage. But when the 37-year-old Duchess of Sussex went overdue , it was determined that it was best for mother and baby to be in a hospital.

Harry and Meghan welcomed a 7lb 3oz baby boy early on Monday morning. The couple will announce their first born 's godparents on the morning of his christening in a few months ' time. Royal infants usually have more than the standard three godparents. Prince Louis has six, future king Prince George has seven and Princess Charlotte has five.

The new baby wo n't be a prince or princess , but he or she will get another title. Queen Elizabeth II is the current sovereign , so her children and grandchildren get royal titles. But her great-grandchildren-like Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's child-would be Lord or Lady Mountbatten-Windsor.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex 's new son will not be titled His or Her Royal Highness ( HRH ) unless the Queen intervenes. HRH status normally lapses after two royal generations - except for Prince George. But the Queen decreed all of William and Kate 's children should be HRH - which is why Princess Charlotte is not Lady Charlotte and Prince Louis is not Lord Louis. George V limited titles within the royal family during the First World War. This is why George V 's grandchildren are HRH but their children are not. However , the rules can be changed if the monarch wishes - so Baby Sussex could still officially become a royal.

Harry and Meghan are celebrating the birth of their first born son- and the rest of us await to see the first pictures of him. Harry is pictured as a baby in Princess Diana 's arms on holiday in Italy aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia on May 6th , 1985. Yet on that same day 34 years on , Harry would hold his young son in his arms for the first time. Meghan is pictured in her mother Doria's arms as the pair feed pigeons in the park together.

China has said it 'deeply regrets' the decision of the US to increase tariffs on US $ 200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. This is raising anxieties given the damaging implications of a trade war between the two economies. Talks are to resume later today in the US but it is anybody 's guess as to where it could be headed. Singapore joins countries initiating legal measures to combat fake news.

The Wise Honest is North Korea 's second-largest bulk cargo ship. It was seized in Indonesia last year for allegedly shipping coal in violation of UN sanctions. The DoJ has asked a federal judge to transfer ownership of the ship to the US through civil forfeiture. This is a controversial legal process that allows authorities to take possession of vehicles and other property involved in felonies.

The Wise Honest was used to transport North Korean coal to China , Russia and other countries, generating badly needed revenue to a country that is under UN sanctions because of its nuclear weapons program. Indonesian authorities intercepted and seized the Wise Honest in the East China Sea a month after it was photographed at the port of Nampo , North Korea, where it took on a load of coal.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's government has been running a network of secret torture facilities across Syria, a new report has found. The rate at which people are being detained in the country is still increasing, despite Assad 's military win in the bloody conflict - now in its ninth year. Memos sent to Syria 's head of military intelligence are reporting the deaths of those imprisoned, the New York Times found.

Muhannad Ghabbash says he was tortured for organizing peaceful antigovernment protests. He was flown to a crammed prison at Mezze air base in Damascus. He says guards hung him and other detainees from a fence naked. To entertain colleagues over dinner, he and other survivors said, an officer called himself Hitler forced prisoners to act.

One government memo urged personnel to complete paperwork to protect officials from future prosecution. The prison system was the government's main weapon against the civilian opposition. Imprisonment and torture crushed the civil protest movement and helped drive the opposition into an armed conflict it could not win. A United Nations panel said conditions amounted to 'extermination . '

As Syria 's president, Bashar Assad, closes in on victory over an eight-year revolt , a secret, industrial-scale system of arbitrary arrests and torture prisons has been pivotal to his success. The New York Times has interviewed dozens of survivors and relatives of dead and missing detainees, reviewed government documents and examined hundreds of pages of witness testimony. The survivors ' accounts align with accounts from other prisoners held in the same jails , and are supported by government memos and by photos smuggled out of Syrian prisons.

As Syria 's president, Bashar Assad, closes in on victory over an eight-year revolt, a secret, industrial-scale system of arbitrary arrests and torture prisons has been pivotal to his success. The Syrian government has denied the existence of systematic abuse. But newly discovered government memos show that Syrian officials who report directly to Assad ordered mass detentions and knew of atrocities.

On Sunday, the Times published an exhaustively reported and harrowing story about Bashar al-Assad 's secret network of prisons. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, nearly a hundred and twenty-eight thousand people are presumed to have been killed in the prisons or are being held there in custody. Former prisoners recalled a guard who went by the name Hitler who forced them to act the roles of dogs and donkeys.

 2020 presidential hopeful says we're looking at a crisis of confidence, potentially a constitutional crisis. Her comments led a wide-ranging interview with Tapper that touched on her views on the Trump administration 's foreign policy, gun control and Facebook. Harris is not the first prominent Democrat to voice concern about aconstitutional crisis.

President Trump is stonewalling an unrelenting investigation by Congress into every aspect of his financial and personal life. The only real Constitutional Crisis is in the investigation now sitting on the Attorney General 's desk. The 2020 election is getting closer everyday and the Democrats have become desperate to regain the White House with presidential candidates making an unprecedented drastic move to the far left.

Why the U.S. is in a Constitutional Crisis. If it was up to the newly elected millennials the current president would have been impeached a long time ago. In fairness though , Pelosi says Trump is 'self-impeaching . ' As the Chinese say : `` May you live in interesting times . ''

A top court in Guatemala is expected to rule on Monday whether or not to uphold a constitutional ban that allegedly prohibits Zury Rios from running for president. Her supporters in Guatemala believe it is unfair for Rios to be judged for the sins of her father , Gen. Efrain Rios Montt. The late RiosMontt served as the right-wing military dictator backed by the United States who helped oust the government of Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia in 1982.

Jerry Nadler, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, says the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis. He says the president is disobeying the law, refusing all information to Congress. Nancy Pelosi and Kamala Harris say we are in a crisis, but with equivocation.

Guatemala 's top judicial body barred the daughter of former military dictator Efrain Rios Montt from participating in the country 's presidential elections in June. The court based its decision on an article of the Guatemalan constitution that bars close relatives of the leaders of coups d'etat from serving as president or vice president. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal will have 24 hours to revoke Rios ' registration, the constitutional court 's secretary general said.

Formal request for a meeting is the closest the Guaidó camp has come to requesting US military intervention to help oust Maduro.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó says he's instructed his political envoy in Washington to open relations with the U.S. military.

The remarks mark one of his strongest public pleas yet for greater U.s. involvement in the country 's fast-escalating crisis.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó today said he 's instructed his political envoy in Washington to immediately open relations with the US military. The remarks mark one of his strongest public pleas yet for greater US involvement in the country 's fast-escalating crisis. Few in the US or Venezuelan opposition view military action as likely nor has the White House indicated it's seriously considering such a move.

Venezuela denounces US provocation in national waters when Guaidó announces contacts with the Southern Command. The escalation of political tension has increased since the failed military uprising last April 30. Padrino López blamed the US for the shortage of food and medicine that the country has experienced since before the sanctions took place.

U.S.-backed Guaidó is leading a campaign to oust President Nicolás Maduro. In recent days Venezuelan security forces arrested National Assembly Vice President Edgar Zambrano. Other lawmakers also scrambled for refuge in foreign embassies amid renewed fears of a crackdown following an unsuccessful military rebellion.

Attorney General William Barr has asked the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, John Durham, to review the origins of the Russia investigation. In congressional testimony last month, Barr expressed concern about the possibility of 'improper surveillance' of the Trump campaign. This is the third investigation into the originsof the Russia probe. The Justice Department 's inspector general is examining the Justice Department's handling of the investigation.

Top federal prosecutor in Connecticut is assisting Attorney General Bill Barr in his review of the genesis of the 2016 Russia investigation. US attorney John Durham has been tapped to help Barr , but is not acting as a special counsel like Robert Mueller. Durham is a Trump appointee who has investigated numerous public corruption cases under Republican and Democratic administrations.

Trump must respect the law, writes Jeff Foster of Carrollton. GOP abandons Constitution, writes Susan E. Lee of Mesquite. The Founders devised a system of government that would make it difficult for tyrants to accumulate enough power to overwhelm our institutions, writes Carol London of Dallas.

William Barr, the U.S. Attorney General, published a four-page letter to Congress announcing the results of the Mueller report. Robert Mueller concluded that Trump and his campaign had neither colluded nor conspired with the Russian government. The report detailed 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice by President Trump.

Attorney General William Barr faces calls to resign from congressional Democrats. Democrats say Barr has acted more like President Donald Trump 's personal attorney than the nation 's chief law enforcement officer. Former Justice Department officials and historians say there has been a long-standing tradition that the Justice Department runs its investigations independent of the Oval Office.

The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee is calling a Democratic effort to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress ' illogical and disingenuous. The move escalates tensions between the Democrat-led House and President Donald Trump 's administration over Mueller 's investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 election.

Barr Contempt William Barr 's extraordinary performance as a Trump lawyer and apologist while donning the hat of Attorney General is astounding. This is the same William Barr who dismissed all the charges in the Iran-Contra affair . Drugs for arms is okay I guess if you 're the president and you want to go around Congress.

Swedish prosecutors have reopened an investigation into a rape allegation against Assange. The inquiry has been revived at the request of the alleged victim 's lawyer. Assange has avoided extradition to Sweden for seven years after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. The 47-year-old was evicted last month and sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions.

Julian Assange is serving a prison term in Britain for jumping bail. The United States has already begun trying to extradite Mr. Assange. The investigation stems from an accusation in August 2010 made by a Swedish woman. British officials will determine which case takes precedence, Swedish prosecutors say.

The lawyer for a Swedish woman who reported being raped by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2010 says `` today we got great news . '' Elisabeth Massi Fritz says the decision by Swedish authorities to open the rape case against Assange signals that no one stands above the law. Assange is serving a 50-week prison term in London for jumping bail in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face the allegations.

WikiLeaks has been a key source of revelations about the transgressions of the Kenyan political elite. As press revenues shrink and expensive investigative departments are done away with, it becomes ever harder for citizens to get the information they need to hold their governments to account. As many have pointed out, Assange is guilty of little more than an act of journalism - he did no more than other news outlets.

Manning again will not testify on WikiLeaks , risking return to jail. Federal prosecutors have for years been investigating WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Manning served seven years in prison over her transfer of secret diplomatic and military documents. Manning recently spent another two months in lock-up for contempt of court after refusing to answer the grand jury's questions.

All of the documents and computer files left behind by Julian Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London will soon be in the hands of U.S. law enforcement. Assange skipped out on his bail following his 2010 arrest in Sweden on rape charges. Sweden eventually dropped the rape charges, with Assange holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy. Sweden 's top prosecutor now says that on Monday she will announce whether the investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Assange will be reopened.

Security researchers have found a new class of vulnerabilities in Intel chips which, if exploited, can be used to steal sensitive information directly from the processor. Almost every computer with an Intel chips dating back to 2011 are affected by the vulnerabilities. The bugs are reminiscent of Meltdown and Spectre , which exploited a weakness in speculative execution, an important part of how processors work.

Intel reportedly believes foldable laptops could hit the market in the next 2 years. Flexible devices are seen as the future as touted by Samsung and Huawei. But the Samsung Galaxy Fold screen malfunction made many tech companies and consumers rethink about the potential of the foldable tech. Intel has confirmed that it will ship 10nm Ice Lake CPUs in June.

Tensions between Iran and the United States have reached high levels since Trump announced that he would withdraw from the landmark nuclear agreement. Iran said it would pull back on its commitments under the agreement and begin a uranium enrichment program.

The US government has approved the deployment of a Patriot missile defence battery and another warship to the Middle East. The deployments of military hardware to the region comes in response to heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations. Tensions between Iran and the US have escalated sharply in recent weeks. Iran has dismissed the moves as psychological warfare designed to intimidate it.

Yuval Steinitz, Israel's energy minister, warned Sunday that escalating tensions between the US and Iran may lead the Islamic Republic to launch a missile assault against Israel. Steinitz added that Iran may also choose to attack Israel by activating its proxies, Lebanon 's Hezbollah or Gaza 's Islamic Jihad. His comments follow a report on Israel 's Channel 13 on Friday that said Israel had warned the US that Iran was contemplating targeting Saudi oil production facilities. Such a strike would also send world oil prices soaring and enable Iran to get more income from its oil sales.

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have said their oil tankers were targeted by sabotage operations near the Strait of Hormuz. Who is behind the attack ? What was the scale of it ? Answers to these and other questions are shrouded in mystery. All this has come amid signs of intensifying conflict between the US and Iran.

Ocean Odyssey is all set to launch up to 10 new locations in Saudi Arabia. The first of such experiences will be situated in the city of Riyadh starting in 2019. Ocean Odyssey has a partnership with KBW Ventures and its partner , the General Entertainment Authority of Saudi Arabia .

Oil prices spiked by 2 per cent on Monday on supply concerns following attacks on two oil tankers from Saudi Arabia. Strait of Hormuz is one of the busiest shipping routes in the world through which 40 per cent of traded global oil passes daily.

Jordan - which borders Saudi Arabia to the northwest - is considered the main contender. Egypt is another possibility, with stages crossing the Gulf of Aqaba or the Red Sea.



Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices using a major vulnerability in messaging app WhatsApp. A fix was rolled out on Friday, but WhatsApp urged all of its 1.5 billion users to update their apps as an added precaution. The surveillance software involved was developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, according to a report in the Financial Times.

The flaw allows the app to be attacked through a missed call. Until the update was released there was nothing an affected user could do. Once hit, the phone would be compromised without the user knowing. The technology to use the attack appears to have been created by an Israeli company that sells technology exploits to governments. An update is now available for all major platforms that fixes the bug.

Dozens of people demanded their cash and jewellery back from Metro Bank in Northwest London on Saturday. Customers had fallen victim to a false rumour spreading on WhatsApp that the bank may be shut down or going bankrupt. The episode shows how difficult it is to counter fake news circulating inside WhatsApp 's private, encrypted environment.

WhatsApp has updated its FAQ posted on its website last week. The messaging app says it will further discontinue services on some Android and iPhone versions effective from February 1, 2020. It will also discontinue service on all Windows Phone operating systems after December 31, 2019.

A report from The Financial Times details a vulnerability in WhatsApp that allowed attackers to inject Israeli spyware onto phones. The malicious code was developed by Israeli company NSO Group and transmitted by calling users via WhatsApp on iOS and Android. In many cases, the call would disappear from call logs, so it 's possible that users could have been targeted and not even realize it.

Vulnerability in messaging app WhatsApp allowed attackers to install Israeli spyware. The malicious code was installed on both iPhones and Android phones. The spyware could be transmitted even if the target victim did n't answer their phone. WhatsApp engineers were working to close the vulnerability Sunday night and issued a patch on Monday.

Attackers were able to install surveillance software on to both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app 's phone call function. The malicious code could be transmitted even if users did not answer their phones. The calls often disappeared from call logs, according to a spyware technology dealer.

WhatsApp just fixed a vulnerability that allowed malicious actors to remotely install spyware on affected phones. An unknown number reportedly did so with a commercial-grade snooping package usually sold to nation-states. This is an extremely severe security hole, and it is difficult to fix the window during which it was open.

The Facebook-owned company confirmed that a select number of users had been victims. The bug affects all but the latest version of the app on iOS and Android. The software could be sent to phones even if the user did not answer the WhatsApp call. Amnesty International is fighting for the NSO Group to have its export license withdrawn by Israeli government.

Brazil 's National Student Union called for protests against what it called spending cuts. The education ministry said it was freezing nearly a quarter of discretionary spending. The marches in more than 200 cities mark the first national protests against the Bolsonaro administration. A peaceful rally of thousands in central Rio de Janeiro turned violent as the protest was ending.

Tens of thousands join in demonstrations across Brazil on Wednesday to protest big cuts in federal funding for public education. It is the first nationwide rallies organized against far-right President Jair Bolsonaro since he took office Jan. 1. Education experts, professors and students say they are particularly worried about the government freezing 30 % of the discretionary budgets at all federal universities.

Various groups in Dallas railed against Bolsonaro and the World Affairs Council event. The event is hosted by billionaire Ray Hunt and philanthropist Nancy Marcus. The council often serves as a liaison between foreign governments and public and private entities in North Texas. Five Dallas City Council members urged Falk to disinvite the Brazilian president.

Students and teachers from hundreds of universities and colleges across Brazil began a nationwide demonstration on Wednesday ( May 15 ) in defence of education. The protest movement was sparked by Education Minister Abraham Weintraub recently slashing federal university subsidies by 30 per cent. Despite the cuts affecting only federal institutions , the protest movement has been joined by many private universities.

Brazil 's National Student Union called for protests against what it called spending cuts. Education Ministry said it was freezing nearly a quarter of discretionary spending.

Morales did not appear to have suffered any serious injuries beyond a cut on his hand. A second person at the helipad suffered injuries , possibly from debris from the crash , and was treated at the scene.

A pilot program is being designed to consolidate 85 State Government-provided services into a one-stop shop in Bunbury. Just under $ 7 million has been allocated to the ServiceWA pilot which will bring together five departments under the one roof. Premier Mark McGowan said the initiative would change the way the Government serviced the community.

The pilot got out of the water safely, the NYPD said. The pilot suffered non-life-threatening injuries, CBS 2 reported. A person on the ground near the dock was hurt after being struck by flying debris. The crash occurred near the recently opened Hudson Yards development.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has praised Fiji as a strong committed partner in peacekeeping and for taking a leading role in the battle against climate change. He was speaking after formal talks with the Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama this morning. Pacific Island leaders asked the UN Secretary General to tell the world their region is running out of time for climate action.

Solar radiation management, or SRM, is a serious option-one that scientists and policymakers are entertaining more and more. The U.N. claims we 're on a path to see global temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Preliminary research indicates the technique is relatively safe.

In the US climate change is a value , not a fact. In the U.S. it is considered a value, not an fact. It is not a matter of fact, but a value of what it means to be a "climate change" person. It's a value that can be used to make decisions.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is preparing to launch a major push for progress on climate change with a historic visit to the Pacific. The UN chief is currently in New Zealand and will later today head to Fiji where he 'll meet with Pacific island leaders in Suva for the first time.

Antonio Guterres has kicked off a major United Nations push for progress on climate change. He is set to visit several Pacific islands where rising sea levels are threatening existence. The stepped-up diplomacy will culminate with a climate action summit at the UN in September. The event is billed as the last chance to prevent irreversible climate change, three years after the Paris agreement.

Guardian Australia gives climate change reporting the prominence it deserves , stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. Polling by foreign policy thinktank Lowy found the majority of Australians believe global warming is a critical threat. From a list of 12 threats to Australia 's national interests , more than 60 % of adults rank climate change as No 1.

On May 10, Reuters reported that Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden plans to combat climate change. The plan includes rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and regulating the United States ' fossil fuels and nuclear energy emissions. On May 14, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared to address Biden 's climate change plan during an event in Washington, D.C. She called out the plan as a "middle-of-the-road approach" and said it was a "deal breaker" Biden responded the same day, saying that he did not think Oc Alexandria was referring to him.

There are articles published by climate deniers and organizations that fund the fossil fuel industry that blatantly say that climate change is a myth made up to scare the masses. Like fake news stories , we have to be vigilant in learning to recognize what is the truth , according to scientists , and what is being made up. It takes diligence and time to research an article or lesson plan , simply to find out if it is worth teaching.

Canadian politicians are expected to debate Thursday whether or not to declare a national climate emergency. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna is tabling a motion that would state climate change is a "real and urgent crisis" The declaration comes one day after the NDP tabled a similar motion. There are no policy changes that come from the motion, experts say.

On Wednesday, May 15, the federal NDP will use an opposition day in the House of Commons to focus like a laser on climate change. Jagmeet Singh 's party will make some sweeping and bold policy proposals. The Doug Ford government of Ontario will soon be airing blatantly one-sided ads with a simple and simplistic message.



U.S. sources believe Iran encouraged Sunday 's attacks on four oil tankers in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia 's announcement on Tuesday that armed drones hit two of its oil pumping stations. There has been a marked increase in U.S.-Iranian tensions since Trump 's decision to cut off all of Iran 's oil exports.

A top UAE diplomat says the coalition will retaliate hard over attacks on civilian targets after the Yemen rebels ' drone attack on a Saudi pipeline. Oman says regional and international efforts should be aimed at avoiding jeopardizing the security of the region after four oil tankers were subjected to alleged acts of sabotage. The Czech Defense Ministry says the country 's military is continuing with its training operations in Iraq.

The vessels were approaching the Strait of Hormuz, the world 's most important chokepoint for oil shipments. The UAE foreign ministry on Sunday reported an attack on four commercial ships near its territorial waters. The precise nature of the incident remained unclear - neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE said exactly what happened. The report comes at a time of heightened tensions in the Gulf.

U.S. sending Patriot missile system and another warship to Middle East amid Iran tensions. The Pentagon said Friday that the USS Arlington , an amphibious transport ship , and a Patriot air defense system will be deployed to the region. The move comes amid rising tensions between Iran and the West.

EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini met privately with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday. She said the EU had called on Pompeo and the US to show restraint at a crucial moment in dealing with Iran. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he again told Pompeo that Berlin did not want a military escalation.

Iran will announce it is partially withdrawing from the nuclear deal it struck with world powers. President Hassan Rouhani will explain Iran 's decision in letters to leaders of Britain, France and Germany. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif separately will write to the European Union. The White House has announced the deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier and a bomber wing.

Senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander says U.S. military presence in Gulf now represents a target. U.s. military has sent forces, including an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers, to Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln is replacing another carrier rotated out of Gulf last month. Iranian navy commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said American forces must exit.

The U.S. has maintained a vast network of bases across the Persian Gulf dating back to the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. The Pentagon announced it would be returning a Patriot missile battery to the wider Mideast, as well as sending the USS Arlington. The USS Kearsarge , an amphibious assault ship carrying Marines and warplanes, just left the Persian Persian Gulf and is nearby in the Arabian Sea.

US issues security alert on Iraq amid regional tensions. Warning follows Washington 's deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf. Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have rocketed since President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the 2015 nuclear treaty.

Spain has temporarily pulled out a frigate that was part of a U.S.-led combat fleet from waters near the Persian Gulf. Two Saudi oil tankers and a Norwegian-flagged vessel were damaged in what Gulf officials described Monday as a "sabotage" attack. The incident raised risks for shippers in a region vital to global energy supplies.



San Francisco is the first US city to ban the use of facial recognition technology. The emerging technology will not be allowed to be used by local agencies. Any plans to buy any kind of new surveillance technology must now be approved. Opponents of the measure said it will put people 's safety at risk.

Bryan Carmody says San Francisco police tried to break into his home with a sledgehammer. Police seized computers, notes and more from his residence and office, he says. Carmody told The Chronicle that officers had asked him for his source two weeks earlier. Journalists must be able to keep their sources confidential to conduct unfettered reporting, he writes.

San Francisco is on track to become the first U.S. city to ban the use of facial recognition. Lawmakers from both parties are looking to curtail government surveillance. The technology is creeping into airports, motor vehicle departments, stores and stadiums. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the bill Tuesday.

How facial recognition became a routine policing tool in America. The technology is proliferating amid concerns that it is prone to errors and allows the government to expand surveillance without much oversight. There are also concerns that facial recognition is not always accurate and that it can be abused by the government.

San Francisco may become the first city in the country to ban municipal use of facial recognition software. The Board of Supervisors will vote Tuesday on a proposal that would bar city departments from using the technology, except at federally regulated facilities. Departments would also have to disclose all the surveillance technology they currently use and get board approval for any new technology.

Mayor London Breed told the bankrupt power giant in March that the city may submit a formal offer for the utility 's electric distribution system in San Francisco. PG & E filed for bankruptcy in January under the weight of an estimated US $ 30 billion in liabilities from wildfires. The agency estimated that the fair market value of the assets is in the range of a few billion ( US ) dollars.

San Francisco to vote on banning face recognition technology. San Francisco is on track to become the first U.S. city to ban the use of facial recognition by police and other city agencies. Studies have shown error rates in facial-analysis systems built by Amazon , IBM and Microsoft were far higher for darker-skinned women than lighter-skinned men.

San Francisco supervisors will vote on surveillance oversight legislation Tuesday. It includes a ban on the use of facial recognition technology by police and other city departments. If approved by the full board, San Francisco would become the first U.S. city to outlaw the tech. Privacy advocates have squared off with public safety proponents at several heated hearings.

Germany has some 60 soldiers stationed north of Baghdad to train Iraq security forces as well as 100 more troops in the Kurdish regions of northern Iraq. Germany 's decision to call a halt to the training missions follows steps from Washington to put US troops on high alert and remove some diplomatic staff. The Netherlands has suspended its military training mission because of a security threat.

The Dutch government has suspended a mission in Iraq that provides assistance to local authorities due to a security threat. The report gave no details about the nature of the threat. Dutch military personal help train Iraqi forces in Erbil , northern Iraq. Along with other foreign troops, Dutch troops train Iraqi troops.

EU and member states ' foreign ministers told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to exercise maximum restraint and avoid any escalation on the military side with Iran. EU 's top diplomat Federica Mogherini said: "We discussed the ways in which we can further advance on the operationalisation of INSTEX"

The plan could result in the deployment of up to 120,000 troops to the Middle East, according to a New York Times report. The plan calls for the deployment in the event that Iran either attacks US forces or ramps up its nuclear-weapons program. The number of troops deployed would be close to the roughly 130,600 service members deployed to Iraq in 2003. News of the plan comes amid increased tensions between the US and Tehran.

Up to 120,000 troops could be deployed to the Middle East, according to a New York Times report. The plan does not indicate whether US troops would invade Iran, the newspaper said. The number of troops deployed would be close to the roughly 130,600 service members deployed to Iraq in 2003.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a lightning visit Tuesday to Baghdad. His unannounced trip to the Iraqi capital began and ended after nightfall under heavy security. Pompeo 's visit came as the Trump administration intensified its pressure campaign against Iran. Iraq is tightly enmeshed with Iran in trade, security and political matters.

Saudi Arabia 's claim that two of its oil tankers have been sabotaged off the coast of the UAE is vague in detail. Any attack on shipping in or close to the Strait of Hormuz is always serious because it is the most important choke point for the international oil trade. A significant armed action by the US or its allies against Iran would likely provoke Iranian retaliation.

Iran-US standoff is finding a surge of increments, provocations and howlers. Threats to close the Strait of Hormuz as a retaliation for frustrating Iranian oil sales have been made. President Hassan Rouhani last week made it clear that the Islamic republic would scale back on certain JCPOA commitments.

The Dutch government has suspended a mission in Iraq that provides assistance to local authorities due to a security threat. The report gave no details about the nature of the threat. Dutch military personnel help train Iraqi forces in Erbil , northern Iraq , along with other foreign troops. The Dutch government suspended the mission on Wednesday.

Germany has 160 soldiers involved in training Iraqi forces trying to contain Islamic State militants. The Netherlands has 169 military and civilian personnel in Iraq, including about 50 in Erbil where they are helping to train Kurdish troops. The U.S. State Department ordered the pullout of some employees from both its embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Iraqi Kurdistan.



Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed the state 's controversial near-total abortion ban Wednesday evening. The new law is the most restrictive anti-abortion measure passed in the United States since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. The legislation makes no exceptions for victims or rape or incest. The governor 's signature comes less than 24 hours after the Senate passed the controversial law.

But she added that, at least for the short term, this bill may similarly be unenforceable. "We must always respect the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court even when we disagree with their decisions," she said. "Many Americans , myself included, disagreed when Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973"

In recent months, even our policy debates have sunk to new lows, says Cynthia Allen. Allen: Too many of us have become less serious, susceptible to absurd arguments. She says a state representative from her hometown of Philadelphia harassed an elderly protester. Allen says if we want to participate in the debate, we must do so with rational arguments.

Alabama lawmakers were scheduled to vote on a bill that would all but ban abortion in the state. Republican Del Marsh, president of the state Senate, asked a group of young mothers what they wanted the legislature to do. Marsh asked the women to keep praying for him as he navigates a contentious fight. A vote on the bill has been rescheduled for Tuesday.

Jenna King-Shepherd and Dina Zirlott are two Alabamians from very different walks of life. Jenna had an abortion at 17 years old; Dina was raped at 17 and denied an abortion. They say they are advocates for those who have had our experiences, those whose experiences we 'll never know.

Alabama senators will vote on the heavily debated , highly controversial abortion bill on Tuesday. Representative Terri Collins is urging senators to pass the abortion bill as is with no exceptions unless the pregnancy compromises the life of the mother. The bill aims to criminalize abortion and directly oppose Roe v. Wade , which Collins hopes gets a now conservative majority Supreme Court 's attention.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Tuesday signed into law one of the nation 's most restrictive abortion laws. The measure bans the procedure once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks. The bill includes provisions for alimony , child support and even income tax deductions for fetuses.

Opponents of the bill , which would ban abortions after about six weeks , say that some women would not know if they were pregnant by that time. The bill now moves to the House. Shortly before the Senate passed the bill, it overwhelmingly rejected a bill aimed at abolishing the death penalty. This rejection followed an emotional hearing in a Senate judiciary committee last week that supported an end to capital punishment.

Alabama Senate to vote Tuesday evening on proposal to outlaw almost all abortions. Bill would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony. Only exception would be for when the woman 's health is at serious risk. Supporters say the bill is intentionally designed to conflict with Roe v. Wade decision.

Alabama lawmakers are expected to vote Tuesday evening on a proposal to outlaw almost all abortions in the state. The measure has splintered Republicans over its lack of an exception for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Supporters say the bill is intentionally designed to conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court 's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationally.

Tension in Muslim-majority Kashmir has been high since a Feb 14 suicide bomb attack by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad ( JeM ) militant group. Kashmir is at the heart of decades of hostility between India and Pakistan. The nuclear-armed neighbours both claim it in full but rule it in part. The rivals have fought three wars since their independence , two of them over the Himalayan region.

Three suspected militants and an Indian Army soldier were killed in a counter-insurgency operation. A civilian was also killed in the crossfire between the rebels and security forces. The incident kicked off when a team made up of army, police and paramilitary forces cordoned off an area.

Security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Delipora village of Pulwama following information about the presence of terrorists.

Since mid-April, members of three activist groups have been occupying the embassy. The activists oppose U.S. intervention in Venezuela to oust President Nicolas Maduro. Authorities arrested the last four protesters on Thursday after utilities for the building were cut off and they ignored an eviction order, the groups say.

American police have forcibly removed four protesters who have been living inside the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington DC for more than a month. The embassy has been the site of a standoff between supporters of the country 's president Nicolas Maduro and backers of opposition leader Juan Guaido. Mr Guaido 's appointed ambassador to the US , Carlos Vecchio, said that the removal of the four protesters represents a liberation for the embassy.

All flights between the U.S. and Venezuela are suspended indefinitely. The Department of Homeland Security made the decision. The Rev. Jesse Jackson delivered food and water to four activists living inside the embassy. For several weeks there has been a standoff at Venezuela 's Embassy in D.C.

Chief justice of Venezuela's Supreme Court had doubts about opposition leader. Juan Guaidó made a surprise appearance with troops at a military base in Caracas on April 30. But the broader military support never materialized, and Maduro's forces moved against opposition protesters. The failure of the uprising has cast new uncertainty on the opposition 's months-long effort.

Journalists help reporter Gregory Jaimes. Jaimes was injured while covering clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters in the Altamira neighborhood of Caracas, Venezuela, on May 1 , 2019. He is being treated at a hospital in Caracas. He has been released from the hospital.

The development appears to reflect a recognition that neither side has been able to prevail in the struggle for power. It was also a policy reversal for the opposition, which has accused President Nicolás Maduro of using previous negotiations to play for time. Senior members of both sides will be involved in the exploratory discussions in Oslo.

After staging a failed uprising, the Western-backed Venezuelan opposition is seeking a meeting with U.S. military officials. The opposition is planning to bolster its leadership challenge against the leftist government of Nicolás Maduro. Many countries including the US , Canada and Chile have recognized officially recognized Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

Ivo Daalder: The Venezuelan opposition and its backers in D.C. are beginning to realize that regime change is n't all that easy to do. He says there are an increasing number of voices pointing to military intervention as the last , best option to get rid of Maduro. DaalDer: But military intervention led by the United States is not the answer.

Four activists remain in the Venezuelan Embassy after police raided the building Monday night. Activists with CODEPINK, ANSWER Coalition and Popular Resistance have been inside the building since late April. They are trying to prevent it from being taken over by Venezuela 's U.S.-backed opposition led by Juan Guaidó.

Venezuela has been in political turmoil since assembly speaker Juan Guaido declared himself acting president in January. Peace talks have taken place at a secret location in the Norwegian capital for several days and are expected to conclude on Thursday. It is the second time that such talks have been held in Oslo between Maduro 's regime and Guaido 's representatives, NRK said.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed substantial reforms to the Civil Rights Act. The bill would protect LGBTQ Americans from discrimination in applying for credit, housing, employment.

Conservative women and radical feminists are calling on Congress to protect women 's safety and dignity from the dangers of the deceptively-named Equality Act. The Equality Act would redefine sex in our federal civil rights laws. Men could claim our rights just by claiming to be women, says Doreen Denny.

President Donald Trump came out publicly against the Equality Act on Monday evening. The White House 's stated opposition is consistent with actions taken by the president and his administration since taking office. The Human Rights Campaign issued a statement denouncing Trump 's opposition. The likelihood of an LGBTQ rights bill being signed into law will not happen until Democrats gain control of the White House.

William Donohue: The Equality Act is the most comprehensive assault on religious liberty in U.S. history. He says it would mean that homosexuals and the sexually challenged would qualify for affirmative action. The act would effectively gut the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, he says. The bill is madness on stilts, and the American people would be opposed to it, he writes.

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said Thursday morning at a press conference on Capitol Hill that the Democrats ' Equality Act ( H.R . 5) is an 'egregious attack' on religious liberty. The measure would ensure that gender ideology - i.e. transgender bathrooms, forced preferred pronoun use , and biological men playing women 's sports , etc. - is cemented into federal law. The bill has 240 sponsors, including two Republican co-sponsors.

Seth Moulton, one of the nearly two dozen candidates campaigning for president in 2020, tweeted his support for LGBTQ workplace protections on Monday.

The Equality Act would impose government-mandated gender identity policies in schools, hospitals and women 's spaces across the country. Monica Burke: The bill would undermine parents ' ability to do what is best for their children. Burke: It would also politicize medicine for adults and children. It would erase women and effectively end any women's-only spaces.

Dubbed the Equality Act, the bill is a top priority of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi says it will bring nation closer to equal liberty and justice for all. Most Republicans oppose the bill and call it another example of government overreach. A similar bill in the Senate has been co-sponsored by all but one Senate Democrat.

Democrats in the House are poised to approve sweeping anti-discrimination legislation. The bill would extend civil rights protections to LGBT people. The protections would extend to employment, housing, loan applications, education, public accommodations. Most Republicans oppose the bill and call it another example of government overreach.

From 20 May 2019 all SI units are defined in terms of constants that describe the natural world. This will assure the future stability of the SI and open the opportunity for the use of new technologies, including quantum technologies, to implement the definitions. The seven defining constants of SI are: the caesium hyperfine frequency Cs ; the speed of light in vacuum c ; the Planck constant h ; the elementary charge e ; the Boltzmann constant k ; and the Avogadro constant N A.

The new System of Units ( SI) to measure weight, temperature, amount of substance , and current came into operation in India from Monday. The resolution to redefine four of the seven base units was adopted at the 26th General Conference on Weights & Measures in November 2018. The existing definition of the kg is over 130 years old.

The 21-storey structure in Pennsylvania was opened in 1972, but had been vacant for the past 12 years. It took just 16 seconds to bring down 16,000 tonnes of steel, as the defunct Bethlehem Steel company 's former headquarters was demolished on Sunday. The building was demolished in just over an hour.

At 21 stories tall, Martin Tower used to be home to Bethlehem Steel. Efforts to save the building did not succeed. Streets will be closed around the tower on Sunday morning. Newswatch 16 will be live in Bethlehem when the building is imploded at 7 a.m.

Martin Tower, the Lehigh Valley 's tallest building, will be imploded Sunday morning. The 332-foot building opened in 1972 and it may be the region 's most polarizing. Some view it as an architectural gem - it sits on the National Register of Historic Places. Others see it as a symbol of the greed that brought down the Steel Corp.

Weather could play a role in the Martin Tower implosion proceeding as planned. The National Weather Service says the forecast is looking good for the demolition to go off as anticipated at 7 a.m. Sunday. About 350 pounds of charges are being used , along with 88 pounds of dynamite , according to the permit. Road closures begin in the area around the tower at 5 a. m.

Big Easy Easton Brass sent Martin Tower off with a New Orleans-style jazz funeral Saturday. Property owners Norton Herrick and Lewis Ronca are proposing a $ 200 million site redevelopment. The weather is looking favorable for the implosion to go off as scheduled at 7 a.m. Sunday.

A rocket was fired into the Iraqi capital 's heavily fortified Green Zone Sunday night. It landed less than a mile from the sprawling U.S. Embassy, an Iraqi military spokesman said. No one claimed responsibility for the attack that took place after sunset. The apparent attack came amid heightened tensions across the Persian Gulf.

A rocket crashed Sunday in the Iraqi capital 's heavily fortified Green Zone. It landed less than a mile from the sprawling U.S. Embassy, an Iraqi military spokesman said. The apparent attack did not cause casualties, state-run news agency said. It came amid heightened tensions across the Persian Gulf.

President Donald Trump has brought US-Iranian relations to the brink of war. Like the war against Iraq in 2003, the crisis with Iran is a manufactured one. A war between the U.S. and Iran would have incalculable consequences-for Iran 's civilian population, for the entire region, and for the world 's economy.

U.S. Sen. Martha McSally says she hopes for a de-escalation of heightened tensions in the Middle East. She made the remarks after the United States has deployed military assets to the Persian Gulf. President Donald Trump has acknowledged growing tensions with Iran amid reports that country was again pursuing nuclear weapons.

Hamid Baeidinejad is Iran 's ambassador to the United Kingdom. He says the U.S. is trying to drag Iran into an unnecessary war. The United States and Iran have no formal diplomatic channel of communication. Some seasoned Iran experts fear the focus on possible threats from Iran are being driven by hawks.

Iran rejects negotiations with the US and says it is showing maximum restraint. US officials say deployment of aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf is in reaction to photographs showing Iran had loaded missiles onto small traditional boats. Two major pro-Iran armed groups in Iraq reject allegations they were plotting an attack on US diplomatic installations in the country.

Tensions have risen in recent days, with concerns about a potential U.S.-Iran conflict. The United States pulled some diplomatic staff from its embassy in Baghdad following weekend attacks on four oil tankers in the Gulf. Washington has increased economic sanctions and built up its military presence in the region. Tehran has described those steps as psychological warfare.

State Department orders nonemergency personnel to leave Iraq posts. An earlier warning urged Americans in the country to avoid places known as gathering places for U.S. citizens and to keep a low profile. The State Department says it is working with the Iraqi government to get the situation under control.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sat down with Iraqi officials in Baghdad last week as tensions mounted between America and Iran. He delivered a nuanced message: If you 're not going to stand with us, stand aside. The message underscores Iraq 's delicate position: Its government is allied with both sides of an increasingly contentious confrontation.

Iran has significantly expanded its footprint over the past decade, finding and developing powerful allies in conflict-ravaged countries across the Middle East. Hezbollah is one of the most prominent members of the self-styled axis of resistance, with tens of thousands of Shiite Muslim fighters beholden to Tehran. Iran has used such groups in the past to strike its regional foes, and could mobilize them if the latest tensions with the United States lead to an armed conflict.

Venezuela 's President Nicolás Maduro has proposed bringing forward next year 's election for the opposition-controlled National Assembly. National Assembly President Juan Guaidó dismissed the proposal as `` a farce '' Talks between the two sides via international mediators are under way in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.

Opposition leader Juan Guaidó and other legislators on Wednesday gave speeches denouncing the government of President Nicolás Maduro. Maduro has accused them of conspiring with the United States to stage a coup. The National Assembly has come under increasing pressure from Maduro since the opposition appealed in vain for a military uprising on April 30.

The development appears to reflect a recognition that neither side had been able to prevail in the struggle for power. It was also a policy reversal for the opposition, which has accused President Nicolás Maduro of using previous negotiations to play for time. The planned talks seemed likely to dampen speculation that the United States might be considering military action as a way to end the crisis.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó called for another round of mass protests on Wednesday. On Tuesday, thousands of opposition supporters flocked to a military airbase in Caracas to help the opposition oust President Nicolás Maduro. But after a day of violent clashes, only a small group of rebellious soldiers appeared to have joined anti-government protests. Maduro said his troops successfully defeated the "coup-mongering right"

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US is willing to intervene in Venezuela to help the opposition oust President Nicolás Maduro. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó has made a rallying call for the armed forces to disavow the socialist government. His mass rallies are losing momentum as soldiers fail to defect and protesters are injured. At least one protester was killed and 130 people were injured on Wednesday.

The Trump administration is looking for ways to support Venezuela 's opposition financially, CNN reported. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó is trying to oust President Nicolás Maduro. Money to pay salaries to military and government employees could help Guaidoó gain support. Officials are considering easing sanctions on Venezuelan state companies in a strategic way.

Venezuelan intelligence agents arrested the vice president of the opposition-led national assembly on Wednesday. Edgar Zambrano was leaving his party 's headquarters in Caracas when agents stopped his car. After he refused to leave his vehicle, security forces towed him to the infamous Helicoide prison. The detention is part of a larger crackdown on opposition leaders who participated in last week 's failed military uprising.

South Korea plans to provide $ 8 million worth of medical and nutritional aid for North Korean children. South Korea is also considering sending broader food aid to the country, which says it is suffering its worst drought in decades. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has expressed hopes that aid will help revive diplomacy and engagement with North Korea.

North Korea 's cash-strapped economy is flagging under crippling international sanctions. The slowdown means the traditional elite and a rising merchant class may be feeling pinched. The most privileged government and military officials are estimated to number about 2,000 people. These families share their profits from state enterprises with a newer privileged class called donju.

The State Department said it had approved 94 SM-2 missiles used by ships against air threats. It separately gave the green light to sell 160 anti-air AMRAAM missiles to Japan. North Korea last week tested what the South Korean military said appeared to be two short-range missiles in its second launch in less than a week.

Mr. Trump will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss efforts to rein in North Korea 's missile program and nuclear ambitions. A summit between Mr. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended without a deal earlier this year. The two leaders will also discuss ways to strengthen the United States-Republic of Korea alliance.

The spectacle unfolding on a launch pad on the west coast of North Korea reveals a boastful and media-savvy regime. North Korea said it was fueling a three-stage rocket that could be launched soon , depending on weather conditions. Despite warnings from the United States , China and Russia, North Korea says it was fueled a three stage rocket.

The official Korean Central News Agency said an average of 54.4 millimeters ( 2.1 inches ) of rain fell throughout the country in the first five months of this year. It said that is the lowest level since 1982, when North Korea received 51.2 millimeters of rain on average during the same period. The report came after U.N. food agencies said in a joint assessment that about 10 million people in North Korea were facing severe food shortages.

The White House says Trump will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in conjunction with his trip to Japan for the G-20 summit.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday US will 'sooner or later ' have to reconcile the reality and understand that his country 's purchase of Russian S-400 systems is a done deal. Erdogan stressed that Ankara is also potentially seeking to acquire the next generation S-500 systems - or even engage in co-production partnership.

Turkey is among nine countries developing the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. The U.S. has opposed shipment of the stealth jets if the nation goes ahead with the missile system purchase. Turkey conducted technical studies and found there were no issues over the compatibility of the S-400s and theF-35s.

Russian aircraft maker Tupolev will roll out the Russian Air Force 's next-generation nuclear-capable strategic bomber in 2021 or 2022, according to Russian media reports.

However, in 2015 Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the production of an upgraded variant of theTu-160.

A Russian aircraft entered Estonian airspace Saturday close to the island of Vaindloo in the Gulf of Finland. The plane had a functioning transponder and a flight plan had been filed, though it did not enter into radio contact with Estonian air traffic controllers.

Ömer Taşpınar argues that Turkey 's purchase of a Russian missile-defense system may be a historic mistake with paradigm-shifting consequences for its relationship with the United States. If Ankara goes ahead and takes delivery of the Russian S-400 system, it will also face severe military sanctions under a US law known as Countering America 's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act ( CAATSA ) Taş pınar: The Turkish decision to buy Russian missile defense is symptomatic of a much larger geostrategic predicament : Washington and Ankara no longer share the same strategic interests.

Rodriguez, 77, says he wants to dedicate himself to being a grandfather.

Washington has become the first state in the US to legalise human composting. Under the new law, people can now choose to have their body turned into soil after their death. The process is seen as an eco-friendly alternative to burials and cremations. Loved ones are given the soil to use in planting flowers, vegetables or trees.

A soil test is one of the best ways to make sure your garden will thrive. A soil test will provide you with an analysis of the basic components of your soil. Because soil tests generally take a few weeks to process , the best time to get a test is early spring or in the fall.

Wind, rain and industrial farming methods accelerate soil erosion, UN says. Erosion can be mitigated before the world faces calamitous losses in terms of agricultural yields and critical ecosystem functions, FAO says. Three-day international meeting on the issue begins in Rome on Wednesday.

Soil holds records of our planet 's past and the possibilities of its future sustainability. Like a library, soil houses stories written from the microscopic to the landscape scale of human and evolutionary history. Soil also remembers its natural vegetation - as seeds that can be used to help restore the native plant diversity and ecosystem. We need to cherish and learn from soil now more than ever.

Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer ( MPAES ) will be installed at STL , Sambalpur to upgrade it as a referral laboratory. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ) , Hyderabad will provide the machine which costs ` 4.5 crore. The referral laboratory will be operational by July end this year.

Washington is set to become the first state to legalize human composting. The practice reduces the environmental impact and saves land from being taken up. Washington also has the country 's highest rate of cremation. The bill also permits a process called alkaline hydrolysis, already legal in some states.

Soil holds records of our planet 's past and the possibilities of its future sustainability. Soil holds stories written from the microscopic to the landscape scale of human and evolutionary history. One quarter of all the world 's biodiversity can be found in soil. We need to cherish and learn from soil more than ever.

Washington is 1st state to allow composting of human bodies. Loved ones are allowed to keep the soil to spread the same way they might spread the ashes of someone who has been cremated. Supporters say it 's more environmentally friendly than embalming or cremation. The law takes effect in May 2020.

California 's high-speed rail agency announced Tuesday it is suing the U.S. Department of Transportation and its senior officials. The state accuses the administration of playing politics with a decision that contradicts federal regulations and makes faulty allegations about the project 's lack of progress. The lawsuit further escalates the conflict between California and the Trump administration over a project that aims to make the state a leader in advanced transportation.

Dallas-Houston high-speed rail project dodged a bullet this week when lawmakers released their decision to strike a provision that could have delayed the project. Project developer Texas Central Partners LLC lauded the legislative move. Project opponents say several bills targeting the project would provide common sense regulations to protect property owners in the rail 's path.

Trump administration pulls nearly $ 1 billion from California high-speed rail. State says state abandoned original vision for rail. Trump administration says state has abandoned its vision for the rail system. California says it will continue to work with federal government on other rail projects in the state.

The Federal Railroad Administration said it 's cancelling the money because California has not made progress and has strayed from the project 's original vision. The feud over the money began after Newsom suggested in February that the state should focus first on building a line in the Central Valley. The administration is may still try to force California to return another $ 2.5 billion.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom immediately pledged to take the administration to court. The state has only about $ 20 billion available for the project at this time. The $ 1 billion represents about one-twelfth of the money the state was counting on to pay for the initial 119-mile stretch of tracks. The Trump administration has also threatened to make California return $ 2.5 billion.

Joseph Patrick Thompson: I was disturbed by your lack of fair treatment of both sides of the issue. He said that the rail authority falsely told the federal government that work could be performed when they did not even own the land where the work was to be performed. For this they received $ 3.1 billion of our federal tax dollars , and have squandered it on damage payments to their contractor. This is the kind of debacle we get with politician transportation, he said.

The Federal Rail Administration has pulled funding for California 's High-Speed Rail Project. This will pull $ 929 million in funding from the project, which has never been fully funded. The FRA has also requested the authority return the $ 2.5 billion in funding already given to the project.

Since 1961, California has had some form of agreement with the federal government to provide financial assistance for firefighting. 60 % of California 's forested land - which tends to be fire-prone - is owned by the federalgovernment. So it 's puzzling that the U.S. Forest Service is accusing the state 's local fire departments of overbilling.

The U.S. Forest Service is accusing the local fire departments in the state of over-billing the federal government. The disagreement threatens to upend negotiations to extend that agreement. California's senior senator has sent a letter this week calling for a truce. The Forest Service insists it is moving ahead with its new demands.

Mueller 's report. The White House invoked executive privilege to bar McGahn from complying with a congressional subpoena to provide documents to Congress.

Michael Avenatti is accused of misappropriating client settlement money for personal use. Avenatti pleaded not guilty to 36-count indictment, including 19 tax-related charges. He had offered Nike $1.5 million to conduct an internal investigation and keep the whole thing quiet. But they would only pay $22 million for full confidentiality.

Avenatti says indictment imminent in Nike extortion case. Avenatti was arrested in March after federal prosecutors said he threatened to expose that Nike paid high school basketball players unless the company paid him up to $ 25 million. He denied those allegations and separate charges of tax , wire and bank fraud in California.

New York State lawmakers give final approval to a bill that would clear a path for Congress to obtain President Trump 's state tax returns. The bill is expected to be signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat and regular critic of Mr. Trump's policies.

President Donald Trump spoke at the National Association of Realtors Legislative Meetings and Trade Expo on May 17 in Washington. The event was held at the White House on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The White House said the president was in the middle of a meeting on immigration.

Amendments filed over the weekend would revise the bill. The change could ease the way for passage of the overall bill as early as this week. Democrats say the measure is needed to give congressional committees access to Trump 's tax information. Republicans had denounced the bill as an overly broad, partisan attack on the president.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is rumored to be running for president in 2020. Julian Zelizer says New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, has been ineffective in standing up to Trump. Zelizer: Cuomo is on firmer ground when he notes the politics of it all. He says the president could help New York state climb a long-forgotten climb.

Amendments filed over the weekend would revise the bill so it applies to elected leaders and top public officials. The change could ease the way for passage of the overall bill as early as this week. Under earlier wording, the bill would have applied to any individual or corporation that pays New York taxes.

Amendments filed over the weekend would revise the bill so it only applies to elected leaders and top public officials. The change could ease the way for passage of the overall bill as early as this week. The bill passed the Senate with its original wording earlier this month and was poised for a vote in the Assembly.

The state Assembly on Wednesday will approve a bill that would allow Congress to get President Donald Trump 's state tax returns. The bill would authorize the New York Tax Department to release New York returns to one of three congressional committees upon request. Earlier this month the Trump administration said it would n't provide the president 's tax returns as requested by the House Ways and Means Committee.

Chester 's third anti-Trump demo will take place next month to coincide with the US president 's state visit to the UK. Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will be guests of honour from June 3 to 5. Large demonstrations expected in the capital with speakers, banners, performances and protest songs.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he will not comply with a subpoena from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal. Neal said he expects to take the administration to court as early as next week over the matter. Democrats are seeking Trump 's tax returns under a 1924 law that directs the IRS to furnish such information when requested.

New York Assembly Passes Bill Closing 'Double Jeopardy ' Loophole. Top Democrats in the state framed the change as a way to stand up to President Trump. The legal concept against double jeopardy says prosecutors can not charge and convict someone for the same criminal act twice. Republicans say the bill is tantamount to a poke in the eye to Trump.

18 new exoplanets have been discovered orbiting stars other than the Sun. All of them are roughly Earth-sized - much smaller than the Neptune-sized average found so far. Discovery was made in old data using a new and more sensitive algorithm. Most exciting new planet though is one that appears to be cool enough to potentially host liquid water on its surface.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research have discovered 18 Earth-sized planets beyond the solar system. The worlds are so small that previous surveys had overlooked them. The researchers re-analyzed a part of the data from NASA 's Kepler Space Telescope with a new and more sensitive method.

The smallest of the bunch is only about two-thirds the size of Earth. Two others are also smaller than Earth , while the rest of the crop range up to about twice the size. The most exciting new planet though is one that appears to be cool enough to potentially host liquid water.

Scientists have discovered 18 Earth-sized planets beyond the solar system. One of the smallest known so far and another that could offer conditions friendly to life. Exoplanets are so small that previous surveys had overlooked them, researchers said. New method has potential of finding more than 100 additional exoplanets, they said.

Hackers breached Baltimore 's servers on 7 May and demanded £79,000 in Bitcoin. Ransom has blocked government email accounts and disabled online payments to city departments. Baltimore city officials have so far refused to pay the ransom. It is the second cyber-attack to strike the city in as many years.

On May 7, hackers digitally seized about 10,000 Baltimore government computers and demanded around $ 100,000 worth in bitcoins to free them back up. The city government is refusing to pay, meaning that the government email systems and payment platforms the attack took down remain offline. For two weeks, city employees have been locked out of their email accounts and citizens have been unable to access essential services. This is Baltimore 's second ransomware attack in about 15 months.

A manual workaround for property sales during the recovery will begin Monday. The ransomware shut down many computer systems and has made it impossible for buyers to obtain certificates showing there are no liens against properties. Title insurance companies have been unwilling to approve transactions without those certificates. Sellers will be asked to sign affidavits promising to pay any outstanding debts.

Baltimore still is n't able to provide basic city services two weeks after a powerful ransomware attack. The damage includes police surveillance cameras that are shut down and utilities payment systems that were forced offline. Broad phone and email outages are also forcing city workers to do what work they can with personal laptops and email accounts.

Cities are falling one by one like so many dominoes in a rally to emerging ransomware threats. RobbinHood is only the latest strain to emerge in the market. The average ransom demand is around $ 116,000 for publicly disclosed ransoms. The U.S. and other countries must consider more strategic pathways to shoring up cyber resilience.

CBM is a collaboration between artists, designers, architects and entrepreneurs. CMB is based in New York City, New York and New Jersey.

Attack on city computers prevents employees from sending email and knocked out bill pay websites. Hackers demand more than $ 76,000 worth of bitcoins in exchange for removing the file-locking virus. Baltimore has refused to pay up and the FBI is investigating. The city has not given a timeline for when all services will be restored - and said it could take months.

On May 7, hackers infected about 10,000 of Baltimore city government 's computers with an aggressive form of ransomware called RobbinHood. The hackers demanded the city pay 13 bitcoin ( then $ 76,280 , today $ 102,310 ) to cut the computers loose. But the city has not paid. In the two weeks since, Baltimore citizens have not had access to many city services.

The city immediately notified the F.B.I. and took systems offline. A copy of a digital ransom note stated that the city could unlock the seized files for a price. The authorities have not named any individuals or groups behind the attack. The ransom would have cost about $ 17,000 per system.

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto says the city would not pay a ransom in the event of a cyberattack like the recent one in Baltimore. The hackers in Maryland demanded a ransom from Baltimore City two weeks ago, and warned officials they would lose data after 10 days if it was n't paid. The ransomware struck citywide , but particularly impacted the city 's Finance Department.



A child sex abuse network operating a website from locations including Thailand and Australia has been busted by Interpol. 50 victims identified so far, the youngest of which was aged 15 months. The abuse was carried out by the site 's main administrator in Thailand 's Surin province - Montri Salangam.

Interpol said Thursday that nine people had been arrested in Thailand, Australia and the U.S. 50 children had been rescued after investigators took down an online pedophilia ring. Interpol said its Operation Blackwrist began after it found material that was traced back to a subscription-based site on the dark web.

State and local leaders say more than 250 arrests have been made as part of the metro anti-crime surge. 50 State Police officers were brought in to help Albuquerque police tackle crime along Central Avenue. Police have also seized drugs , guns , and ammo and recovered two dozen stolen vehicles.

Interpol expects more arrests will follow as investigations continue , stemming from an operation into a site on the '' dark web '' that was launched two years ago. Police are trying to identify an additional 100 in images that had been shared on the internet 's uncharted corners. The first arrests came in early 2018 , when the site 's main administrator was detained in Thailand.

Interpol says nine people have been arrested in Thailand, Australia and the US. Fifty children were rescued following the arrests.

Interpol said nine people had been arrested in Thailand , Australia and the US. 50 children had been rescued after investigators took down an online paedophilia ring. More arrests were expected as police in nearly 60 countries pursue investigations. Interpol said its Operation Blackwrist began two years ago into a hidden dark web site with 63,000 users worldwide.

Operation Blackwrist was launched in 2017 after police found material showing the abuse of 11 boys by an online international pedophilia ring. Police said 50 children were rescued , with around 100 more suspected of having suffered abuse. Main administrator Montri Salangam was sentenced to 146 years in prison for child rape , human trafficking as well as possession and distribution of child sex abuse material.

John Walker Lindh, the first US-born detainee in the war on terror, has been released from prison. He will live in Virginia subject to the direction of his probation officer, his lawyer tells CNN. Lindh is said in two US government reports to have made pro-ISIS and other extremist statements. Some are already calling for an investigation into his time in prison that could send him back into detention.

John Walker Lindh, the Californian who took up arms for the Taliban and was captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2001, got out of prison Thursday after more than 17 years. He was released under tight restrictions that reflected government fears he still harbors radical views. Lindh converted to Islam as a teenager and eventually made his way to Pakistan and Afghanistan and joined the Taliban. He met Osama bin Laden and was with the Taliban on Sept. 11, 2001.

John Walker Lindh was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists. He will be released from federal prison on Thursday, three years early, federal officials said. Lindh and other incarcerated American supporters of Islamic terrorists present a quandary. Is the U.S. prepared to try to rehabilitate extremists and foreign fighters, and welcome them back into society?

John Walker Lindh converted to Islam as a teenager and traveled overseas to fight alongside radical Islamists. Lindh was captured in Afghanistan two months after 9/11. He was charged with conspiring to kill Americans and engaging in terrorism. Those charges were dropped and Lindh only pleaded guilty to serving in the Taliban army and carrying weapons while doing so.

Michael W. Trapp, 32, was sentenced Friday in Leavenworth County District Court. He pleaded guilty April 19 to the criminal possession of a firearm and criminal use of a weapon charges. He had a previous felony conviction for possessing a shotgun with a barrel that was less than 18 inches.

John Walker Lindh is scheduled to leave a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Thursday. He was released on probation after serving 17 years of a 20-year sentence for providing support to the Taliban. The government has characterised Lindh in recent years as holding on to extremist views. His release has now brought objections from Spann 's family and elected officials.

Christopher Cleary set off a manhunt when he posted a Facebook message threatening to kill 'as many girls as I see' Cleary, 27, called himself a virgin who never had a girlfriend, stoking fears of another deadly rampage by a man blaming women for his problems. His plea deal with Utah prosecutors appears to fit a pattern of lenient punishments - a common outcome for cyberstalking and online harassment cases.

Bobby Joe Long , 65, was pronounced dead at 6:55 p.m. Thursday following a lethal injection at Florida State Prison. Long had no last words , simply closing his eyes as the procedure began, witnesses said. The killer terrified the Tampa Bay area for eight months in 1984 as women began showing up dead. Law enforcement had few clues until the case of Lisa Noland , who survived one of Long 's attacks and aided in his capture.

Bobby Joe Long is set to receive a lethal injection Thursday at Florida State Prison in Starke.

The Netherlands won the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest with `` Arcade '' by Duncan Laurence. North Macedonia and Sweden battled for first place during the reporting of the jury scores. It 's the fifth win for the Netherlands in the contest 's 64-year history. A large public vote cemented Italy 's runner-up position this year.

The European parliamentary elections in May 2019 represent a major opportunity for Spain to increase its influence in the EU. This analysis reviews the role of the country in the European Parliament since it joined the Union on 1 January 1986. It compares the positions of its political parties and their members with large EU countries. It concludes with some predictions for the May 2019 elections and sets out a roadmap for increasing Spain 's influence.

The European Parliamentary elections are due to take place later this week. All EU citizens living in the UK will have the opportunity to vote in an MEP to represent their region. Political parties have been scrambling to launch last-minute EU election campaigns and pull together a list of candidates. Newly approved party Change UK - formerly The Independent Group - has announced a list including Gavin Esler and Rachel Johnson.

The European Elections will take place on May 23 2019. Voters in Ireland vote on May 25 and the remaining 21 EU nations cast their ballots on May 26. The results from every nation will be released on the evening of May 26 after the last polling station is closed. Why is the UK taking part ? Because Brexit has now been delayed for six months , with a new date set for October 31 2019.

The European Elections are the last chance residents in the UK will have to vote. Voters will be able to choose from a number of parties standing for the honour. The UK has 73 seats in the European Parliament made up of MEPs across the UK 's electing regions. Some 548 candidates are hoping to take their place from across the political spectrum.

The European Elections 2019 run from Thursday , May 23 and Sunday , May 26 across all EU nations. British people have the chance to choose which MEPs they want to sit in the European Parliament. The Parliament is the democratically-elected chamber of the EU responsible for passing laws and approving the EU budget. But the UK is planning on leaving the EU in the long-term so what happens if MEPs are elected and Brexit goes ahead ?

Britons will head to the polls to vote for who they wish to represent them in European Parliament tomorrow. Many voters will likely use their ballot papers to express their true feelings about Brexit - and the shambolic deadlock the UK is still facing. The latest polls predict the eurosceptic Brexit Party - lead by Nigel Farage - will win most votes in the UK. There is no rule against tactical voting in the EU elections. Remainers are being actively encouraged to tactically vote to try and prevent a Brexit Party win.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scored a dramatic election victory on Thursday. His Hindu nationalist party is on course to increase its majority in parliament. His re-election reinforces a global trend of right-wing populists sweeping to victory. But making good on his promise of unity will be difficult as the BJP campaign was divisive.

Most exit polls have predicted that the NDA is likely to retaining power. Verdict of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls will be declared on May 23. The NDA unanimously passed a resolution describing itself as an alliance of dreams and aspirations of the country. The resolution also pledged to make India strong, developed and prosperous by 2022.

BJP chief Amit Shah played host to a gathering of the outgoing Council of Ministers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the party headquarters. This was followed by a dinner for the top NDA leaders in the Capital late evening. The PM expressed concern over the opposition making needless controversy over electronic voting machines.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi met leaders of his ruling alliance and expressed concerns over the doubts raised by the Opposition parties about electronic voting machines. Opposition leaders had raised concerns about the transportation of the voting machines ahead of counting of votes. The Election Commission clarified that the machines were 'absolutely safe' in strongrooms.

'Modi : Journey Of A Common Man ' is live again a month after the Election Commission banned its streaming in favour of a level-playing field during the Lok Sabha elections. Five episodes of the 10-part original series were made available again on OTT platform Eros Now on Tuesday. The remaining five are yet to be out.

BJP-led ruling alliance meeting is being seen as a show of strength and projection of a united front by the ruling alliance ahead of counting of votes on May 23. In his address, Modi stressed on the need to change the narrative from caste lines and orient it for the poor. Opposition leaders met the Election Commission and demanded verification of VVPAT slips of randomly-selected polling stations before the counting of the votes.

In its 2014 election manifesto, Modi 's Bharatiya Janata Party attacked the then Congress Party-led government for unleashing tax terrorism. Cairn Energy transferred ownership of its Indian oil field in 2006 to prepare for the local unit 's initial public offering. But in January 2014, the Indian tax department began questioning the internal transfer of shares.

The Congress party 's attempted rebound has been complicated not just by Modi 's enduring appeal - Indian stocks rose on his favourable exit polls - but also by smaller regional parties that are fighting intensely for a larger share of the political pie. Zoya Hasan, a political scientist and professor emeritus at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, said that while the Congress party had hoped for a strong showing it could rebuild around. But he said it could be years before it is anywhere near as strong as it was after its last electoral victory in 2009.

TransitColumbus calls for a 2020 ballot measure to pay for high-capacity transit. The group envisions the ballot measure taking the form of an increase in the sales tax. Bus rapid-transit lines have dedicated rights of way that allow buses to travel much faster. Transit operators in the United States have been slower to adopt those measures.

Comet 46P/Wirtanen is the third comet measured in recent years to reveal the required protium-deuterium balance. All three belong to a class known as hyperactive comets. They produce more water vapour than the size of their nuclei should permit. The excess is the result of sublimation by icy crystals present in their atmosphere.

Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and the Georg August University of Göttingen have added 18 more exoplanets to the ever-expanding list. The newly-found worlds are some of the smallest detected so far. They range in size from only 69 percent of the diameter of Earth to just slightly more than twice as large as Earth. All of them were hiding in the Kepler data , and were not found in previous searches because the search algorithms were not sensitive enough.

China supplies more than 90 % of world rare earths. Rare earths are absolutely essential to the Pentagon and the US military forces. The US has approximately 13 million metric tons of rare earth elements. The largest mining facility was Mountain Pass Mine in the Mojave Desert in California.

Observations indicate comets may have brought water to Earth Laurel Kornfeld Observations of Comet Wirtanen by the Strategic Observatory for Infrared Astronomy ( SOFIA ) support the notion. A closeup study of this comet revealed water in its coma is very similar to that in Earth 's oceans , meaning both may share a common origin.

First time in Israeli history that a candidate for prime minister failed to form a coalition. Likud initiated the bill to dissolve the Knesset rather than give Rivlin a chance to appoint someone other than Netanyahu. Opposition MKs shouted 'shame, shame, shame' in unison ahead of the vote.

Israelis faced the growing possibility Monday of a new national poll despite a general election last month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's coalition talks remain deadlocked ahead of a looming deadline. Ex-defense minister Avigdor Lieberman has prevented a deal by refusing to budge from a key demand.

The Florida delegation on its historic trade trip to Israel got off to an early start this morning. Gov. DeSantis held a briefing at the Hilton Tel Aviv with the Mediterranean Sea as a backdrop. He said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu exudes strong leadership and that the U.S. should support Israel.

Binyamin Netanyahu battles against a deadline to form a government by midnight tomorrow. MPs squabble over a law to conscript religious students. Mr Netanyahu faces three possible corruption indictments - and his erstwhile allies know that , under pressure , they can increase their price.

Israel 's parliament on Monday passed a preliminary motion to dissolve itself. The move further pushed the country toward an unprecedented political impasse. If the bill receives final passage in a vote scheduled Wednesday, Israel would be forced to hold new elections. Netanyahu appeared to have a clear path to victory after the April 9 elections.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was struggling Monday to sign up coalition partners, thrusting the country into a political crisis. The drama stemmed from a battle of wills between two political forces that Netanyahu needs to form a right-wing coalition. The sides are now wrestling over legislation to replace a military draft law that exempted ultra-Orthodox men.

President Donald Trump offered unprecedented public support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid tense chaos. Trump said in a Monday afternoon tweet that he hopes things will work out with Israel 's coalition formation. Netanyahu thanked Trump for the tweet during a press conference shortly after saying that "we still have a lot of work to do"

 Netanyahu has been unable to reach a deal with potential coalition partners. Negotiations have broken down over legislation aimed at requiring ultra-Orthodox Jews to perform mandatory military service like other Jewish Israelis.

Louisiana 's Democratic governor has signed a highly restrictive new abortion law. The law could prohibit abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It is the latest in a raft of anti-abortion measures which are expected to face legal challenges. Four other states have passed similar limits to abortion this year.

Mississippi 6-week abortion ban heads to federal court. A federal judge struck down Mississippi 's 15- week abortion ban last year. A new law would put the ban even earlier, at six weeks. The ban was struck down by a federal judge in Mississippi.

Mississippi is one of several states that have pushed this year to enact bans on early abortions. Opponents of abortion are emboldened by new conservative Supreme Court justices. Mississippi law would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected. Viability is generally considered to be about 23 or 24 weeks.

Louisiana is set to join a slew of states passing heartbeat bills. This could ultimately lead to a legal challenge against the 46-year-old Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court Decision. Eight states this year have already passed some kind of new legislation that restricts abortion.

St. Louis Archbishop Robert J. Carlson praises Missouri's new law. The law bans abortions on or beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Doctors who perform abortions after eight weeks face five to 15 years in prison. The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri is seeking signatures to repeal the law.

A federal judge is temporarily blocking a Mississippi law that bans most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected. The law is aimed at women who want to terminate a pregnancy before the baby is born. The judge is also trying to protect women in other states from similar laws. The state of Mississippi says the law is unconstitutional.

House lawmakers are scheduled to vote on a bill that would ban abortions when a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat. The bill, authored by Shreveport democrat John Milkovich , does not make exceptions for rape and incest victims. Similar laws have already passed in other states , where opponents have called it an attack on women.

Thousands protest across Brazil over Jair Bolsonaro 's sweeping cuts to education. From Amazon cities to small towns in the deep south, demonstrators turned out to condemn funding cuts. On 15 May tens of thousands of demonstrators staged nationwide protests against the cuts only to be belittled by the president.

The education system is broken in a number of ways, says Erika Garcia Ogden. Teachers are pushed to follow standards and if the student does n't make it, then the teacher is punished, she says. One test can not show you how a student is doing, Ogden says. The results of one test can be skewed by not getting enough sleep, she adds.

Three-quarters of all degree-holders at twenty universities are n't earning enough within five years to start re-paying debts. Courses where students do n't earn the £25,000 threshold soon enough are slammed today by Ministers. Education Secretary Damian Hinds says the startling figures should be a 'wake-up call' for universities.

Advocates who spent the legislative session lobbying for leaps in education spending had to settle for a final budget described as incremental. A suite of coalition-backed proposals got a little more than a tenth of the $ 80 million in funding outlined in the original bill. The bill includes just $ 2.5 million in new funding for efforts that the coalition says would improve outcomes for students of color.

Kelly was arrested in February on charges accusing him of sexually abusing a woman and three girls over roughly a 10-year period starting in the late 1990s.

A number of witnesses testified alleging that Kelly went to great lengths to fulfill his sexual desires. One of the victims testifying against Kelly said that he was paid for not testifying in the 2008 trial where he was acquitted of child sex tapes charges. Some of the witnesses in 2008 were also sent on a vacation so that they were absent during the testimony procedure. The witnesses ' travels were secured by the singer 's team.

Three of the new counts accuse him of sexually abusing a victim between the ages of 13 and 16. It was unclear if this is a new victim or one of the four victims whom Kelly was charged in February with sexually abusing. Kelly is due back in court next week to face the new charges.

Chicago prosecutors charge R & B singer R. Kelly with 11 new sex-related counts involving one victim. Kelly has been accused of having sex with more than one woman. He has denied the allegations and said he has never had sex with a woman in his life. The singer has been charged with sexually assaulting several women in the past.

Fungus - genetically enhanced to produce spider toxin - can rapidly kill mosquitoes. Trials in Burkina Faso showed mosquito populations collapsed by 99% within 45 days. Researchers say their aim is not to make insects extinct but to stop spread of malaria. Malaria is spread when female mosquitoes drink blood and kills more than 400,000 people per year.

Malaria is a serious , complex and often fatal vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium. It is transmitted when people are bitten by infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The mainstay of most malaria control programmes are vector control methods. These include indoor residual spraying as well as the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets. Integrated vector management is a key strategy recommended by the World Health Organisation, particularly for African countries. It involves the use of insecticides that kill mosquitoes in their larval stage - before they develop into adult mosquitoes.

Scientists Genetically Modify Fungus To Kill Mosquitoes That Spread Malaria. Malaria sickens more than 200 million people every year and kills more than 400,000. Researchers used a spider gene to genetically engineer a fungus to produce a venom. The modified fungus was a highly effective mosquito killer in the first tests.

Researchers used a spider gene to genetically engineer a fungus to produce a venom. The modified fungus was a highly effective mosquito killer in the first tests.

Scientists from the University of Maryland and Burkina Faso described the first trial outside the laboratory of a transgenic approach to combating malaria. The study showed that a naturally occurring fungus engineered to deliver a toxin to mosquitoes safely reduced mosquito populations by more than 99 % in a screen-enclosed , simulated village setting. The fungus caused mosquito populations to collapse to unsustainable levels within two generations.

NBA Finals Head To Canada As Raptors Take On Golden State Warriors. For the first time, the NBA Finals will be played in Canada . The Toronto Raptors host the Golden Stateriors on Thursday. NPR 's Audie Cornish talks with Toronto Star sports columnist Bruce Arthur.

The inaugural James Naismith Classic will take place in Toronto on Nov. 16. It will feature three teams that reached the NCAA Tournament this past season. Tennessee will play Washington, Buffalo will play Harvard and Rutgers will play St. Bonaventure. The event will honor the inventor of basketball.

Stephen Curry has won three NBA championships with a potential fourth in sight. Curry has changed the game dramatically with his seemingly infinite supply of range and joy. But Curry remains without something most mega-stars already have : A Finals MVP. Curry stressed that he spoke those words not to demean the award.

Markets in Toronto for June 2019 give you plenty of opportunitites to shop local and pick up some unique , handmade goodies. The Kensington Flea kicks off for the season and you can raid the closet of some Toronto fashion bloggers on the cheap. The Toronto Fashion Week runs from June 14 to 22.

Freedom Ink in Toronto is offering free flash tats in honour of the Raptors' NBA Finals run. The tattoo and piercing shop will be doing free walk-in tats every day from 2 p.m. until 8 p.M. from Tuesday until Friday of this week. All tattoos must be less than 3 x 3 inches and must be done in black ink or as an outline only.

The next four, five, six or seven games of the NBA Finals between Golden State and Toronto will decide the 2019 championship. How this series plays out is inevitably going to affect how free agency unfolds starting in a month or so. It 'll affect Warriors star Kevin Durant and his annual stay-or-go decision. Kawhi Leonard as he ponders his next move , or if he 'll be moving at all. And those are just the biggest fish - the whales , to use a term Miami president Pat Riley likes.

The Toronto Raptors will face the dynastic Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals. The Raps have displayed nimbleness and resilience through three playoff rounds. The Raptors eliminated three teams who played very different styles of basketball. They shuffled defensive assignments, tweaked player combinations and bounced back from punches.

The Golden State Warriors are the most likeable team in the NBA. But even the greatest team eventually gets tiresome. With five championship appearances on the trot, the Warriors have hit that point. The Warriors are cute and they know it. They work hard to fulfill their cuteness quota by saying cute things.

The Warriors and Raptors open the NBA Finals on Thursday night in Toronto. Kevin Durant won't be on the court for the Warriors because of a calf injury. Kawhi Leonard is the best player in the world, but will the Raptors run out of gas? How will the Warriors bid farewell to Oracle Arena?

Kevin Durant is travelling with the Golden State Warriors to Toronto for the first two games of the NBA Finals. Durant is yet to progress to on-court work in his recovery from a strained right calf. The two-time reigning Finals MVP has missed the past five games since getting hurt in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston.

US President Donald Trump has unveiled a new US immigration system favouring young, educated, English-speaking applicants instead of people with family ties to Americans. Fifty-seven percent would be awarded on merit as opposed to the current 12 per cent. To promote integration, assimilation and national unity, potential immigrants would have to pass a civics exam. The plan does not address what to do about millions of immigrants already living in the country illegally. But it does pave the way for allowing public donations to pay for the president 's long-promised border wall.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services removed the words "nation of immigrants" from its mission statement. Lee Francis Cissna was the Trump administration 's most understated and most effective immigration official. The irony is that he was on track to do more to cut legal immigration than any other Trump official.

Wydad Casablanca refused to play when VAR was unavailable to judge a disallowed equaliser. VAR had been set up on the side of the pitch but the players had not been told it was not working. The referee awarded the victory to three-time former champions Esperance. Wydad could now face a two-year ban from competing in continental competition.

Esperance Tunis will create records if they retain the CAF Champions League trophy after the second leg of the final against Wydad Casablanca. The Tunisian club may not even need a victory to achieve their goals -- a 0-0 draw will suffice to win the elite African club competition on away goals after the first leg finished 1-1 in Morocco. Should Esperance be crowned African champions a fourth time , Chaabani will become the first north African coach to secure back-to-back Champions League titles.

The U.S. military confirmed the attack in the Afghan capital and said the service members received minor injuries. The Taliban took responsibility for the bombing on a busy road linking Kabul to the eastern city of Jalalabad. On Thursday, an Islamic State suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate of an Afghan military academy.

For noncombatants living in areas of Afghanistan under Taliban control or influence, the greatest desire is for an end to violence. Taliban members were broadly resistant to the idea of peace talks with the current Afghan government. There was a strong sense that the legacy of the conflict must be addressed as part of any peace process. Justice was seen as a mix of punishment and forgiveness.

Hamdullah Mohib led a high-powered delegation that included the Afghan interior minister. Mohib mission was to hold initial talks on key issues to see if progress was possible during visit of President Ghani. Taliban are currently holding talks with the US but have so far refused to sit across the table with the Kabul administration.

The U.N. interviewed 13 detainees from a group of 53 recently rescued from the Taliban. The group was freed on April 25 when Afghan troops raided a Taliban-run detention facility. The detainees were shackled while in captivity and almost all said they were beaten. The Taliban told them it was punishment for supporting the government.

A high-level Afghan delegation led by national security adviser has held talks with top civilian and military officers in Pakistan. Hamdullah Mohib - who led a high-powered delegation that included the Afghan interior minister - was the first senior Afghan official to have travelled to Islamabad in months. The crucial talks with Pakistani authorities were part of the latest push by the two neighbours to remove irritants in their bilateral ties that have undermined efforts for a peace deal in Afghanistan.

A suicide bomber detonated a vehicle filled with explosives outside the national military academy here. The vehicle exploded as cadets were leaving the hillside campus overlooking the capital. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack came after three days of Afghan talks in Moscow ended Thursday without any significant progress in ending the war.

Taliban official says decent progress made at talks with senior Afghan politicians in Moscow. But there had been no breakthrough in their bid to end 18 years of war and that further talks would be needed. Taliban have been talking for months with U.S. diplomats to agree withdrawal of more than 20,000 international troops from Afghanistan.

The Taliban and other Afghan factions have wrapped another round of talks in Moscow to discuss peace settlement. The negotiations followed a previous round of consultations in February. Russia has sought to play power broker in Afghanistan, attempting to mediate between warring factions. A U.S.-led coalition has been fighting for more than 17 years in Afghanistan.

Calgary registered a 10+ on the Air Quality Health Index on Friday morning, considered a very high risk. A special air quality statement from Environment Canada warned of symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches and shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease such as asthma are especially at risk. Those with breathing difficulties were advised to stay inside, and if possible, to find an indoor place that 's cool and ventilated.

New air quality research shows that cooking is bad for indoor air quality. Cleaning supplies are bad, too, as are teenage boys' Axe body sprays. WHO determined that 4.2 million people around the world die early each year because of outdoor air pollution. More research will need to prove a definitive link between these indoor compounds and our health.

Industrial plants face many challenges when it comes to indoor air quality. Evaporative coolers offer great advantages over refrigerated air conditioning. Breezair filters the incoming air , removing most airborne dust and pollen particles. The wet cooling pads trap most of these particles, which are washed down into the sump.

Environment Canada has issued a special air quality statement for Edmonton and much of central , north Alberta. Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas. The Air Quality Health Index ( AQHI ) for Edmonton is at a 4 ( moderate risk ) and is expected to increase to a 6 ( moderate )

Environment Canada issued special air quality statements from the Edmonton region to the northern tip of the province. A prediction map from FireSmoke.ca indicates the smoke will continue to flow south throughout Thursday. Some people may experience increased coughing, throat irritation , headaches or shortness of breath due to the smoke. Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease are especially at risk.

The Environment Agency says it has paid £15,000 to take more than 350 samples as it investigates what is causing the drop in standards. Bridlington North deteriorated from 'excellent ' to 'good ' in 2017. The aim is for this to be completed before the end of 2019. 17 of the Yorkshire 's 19 bathing waters were rated either 'ex excellent ' or 'good' for the 2019 season.

Smoke from northern Alberta wildfires is causing poor air quality and reduced visibility. Residents could experience coughing , throat irritation , headaches or shortness of breath. Seniors, children and anyone with lung disease are particularly at risk. Anyone with health difficulties should stay in a cool , ventilated place with windows closed.

Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas. People may experience increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease are especially at risk. Smoke is expected to move back toward the north by Friday morning.

Environment Canada issued an air quality alert just after 8 a.m. The city 's Air Quality Health Index is at seven , which is considered high. Smoke is expected to move back north by Friday as the wind flow shifts to southeasterly. Officials warn some might experience increased coughing, throat irritation , headaches or shortness of breath.

A smoky haze blanketed much of southern Alberta on Thursday morning as wildfires in northern Alberta continue to burn. Calgary 's air quality was ranked at 3 , or low risk , on the Air Quality Health Index as of 7 a.m. , but was expected to hit 6 or higher before the end of the day. Environment Canada meteorologist Dan Kulak said the effects of the wildfires could dissipate in southern Alberta later on Thursday.



The Alberta government said hot , dry and windy conditions fueling the northern wildfires are n't going away soon. Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale says Alberta has asked for Canadian Forces assistance. He says federal officials are working with counterparts in Alberta to co-ordinate the response. The province is slightly under the five-year average for number of fires but the amount of land burned is more than 3.5 times higher.

Chuckegg Creek fire , the largest in the province , is still about three kilometres southwest of High Level. The fire near High Level has grown to 1,500 square kilometres - an increase of 200 square kilometres from Tuesday. A new fire around Steen River grew 170 square kilometres in its first day. About 5,000 people were ordered to leave High Level and surrounding communities more than a week ago.

Smoke expected to roll out as cooler temperatures move in. Expect the hazy skies to stick around the Okanagan , Similkameen and Shuswap until at least the weekend. Environment Canada meteorologist Doug Lundquist said the smoke is mostly coming from the Alberta fires with some flow coming from fires in northern B.C.

Smoke expected to roll out as cooler temperatures move in. Environment Canada meteorologist Doug Lundquist said the smoke in the air is mostly coming from the Alberta fires. There are currently 31 active wildfires in B.C. , including 10 discovered in the last two days.

King Juan Carlos I of Spain is retiring from public life. The 81-year-old royal shared his plans to withdraw from public duties in a letter to his son, King Felipe VI. Juan Carlos ' retirement will officially begin on June 2, exactly five years after his abdication. He reportedly wanted to pass the job onto his son before Felipe grew old.

Spain 's King Juan Carlos is abdicating after almost 40 years on the throne and his son Prince Felipe will succeed him. He only discovered Spain when he was 10 and was picked by dictator Francisco Franco to succeed him but instead steered his country to democracy. But the end of his 38-year reign ( 1975-2014 ) was clouded by several scandals until he abdicated in favour of his son Felipe VI.

Former king Juan Carlos I retires from public life on Sunday. Born 81 years ago in Italy, Juan Carlos only discovered Spain when he was 10. He was picked by dictator Francisco Franco to succeed him but instead steered his country to democracy. But the end of his 38-year reign ( 1975-2014 ) was clouded by several scandals until he abdicated.

Juan Carlos de Borbón will spend the first day of his retirement from public life on Sunday lapping up the sunshine at a bullfight south of Madrid. Juan Carlos was piqued after planning to accompany King Felipe VI at Saturday 's annual Armed Forces Day in Seville. His son and Queen Letizia decided this was not a good idea.

Juan Carlos de Borbon will retire from official duties today. He will preside over a bullfight in the city that inspired Joaquin Rodrigo 's Concierto de Aranjuez. From a royal box in the arena , Juan Carlos will observe the bloody pageant.



North Korea executed its nuclear envoy to the United States, a South Korean newspaper says. Kim Hyok Chol was executed in March at Mirim Airport in Pyongyang, the Chosun Ilbo says. He was accused of spying for the U.S. for poorly reporting on the negotiations. The February summit in Vietnam between Kim and Trump failed to reach a deal.

North Korea has executed five officials for their part in the failed second summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Kim Hyok Chol, North Korea 's special envoy to the U.S., was executed by firing squad in March. The paper also claimed that four other North Korean Foreign Ministry officials were executed that same month because of the breakdown of the February summit in Hanoi.

Kim Hyeok-cheol was killed at Mirim Airfield after he and four other officials were investigated in March, it is claimed. The oppressive regime led by Kim Jong Un previously sentenced four officials to death over the failed Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam earlier this year. The officials are said to have been killed by a firing squad in Pyongyang.

North Korea executed Kim Hyok Chol, its special envoy to the United States. Four foreign ministry officials who carried out working-level negotiations for the second U.S.-North Korea summit were also held responsible for its collapse. The North Korean leader is believed to be carrying out a massive purge to divert attention away from internal turmoil.

Huawei moves US court against Trump ban. Chinese telecom giant Huawei filed a motion for summary judgment as part of a process to challenge the constitutionality of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. In its complaint, Huawei argues that Section 889 of 2019 NDDA singles out Huawei by name and bars US government agencies from buying Huawei equipment and services.

The Huawei case is drilling a hole at the bottom of the ship, says Xiaomeng Lu. Lu thinks Huawei will not win the case since U.S. courts always side with the other two branches on national security issues. Ted Bauman, Senior Research Analyst and Economist at Banyan Hill Publishing, agrees.

Pompeo: Huawei is an instrument of the Chinese government. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd filed a motion late on Tuesday for summary judgment in its lawsuit against the U.S. government.

Malaysia 's support in using Huawei products is an assurance that not all countries consider the Chinese tech giant a threat, an official of the firm says. Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad earlier said the country will use Huawei 's products 'as much as possible' amid security concerns and a US ban on the Chinese firm.

I respond to the Associated Press article " China 's Huawei says US actions unconstitutional" Why did a court even take this case ? Imagine , a foreign company demands protection under a law that was never intended to cover its actions. Now , would a time machine take us back to point this out to the original authors ?

China has deployed an unlikely voice in its trade war with the U.S. : Trevor Noah of Comedy Central 's The Daily Show. A brief clip from the comedian 's segment on Chinese equipment maker Huawei ran on state broadcaster CCTV 's national lunchtime news on Monday. Washington says Huawei is a security threat and is obliged to do the ruling Communist Party 's bidding.

China has put preparations in place to restrict exports of rare earth minerals to the US. China is also setting up its own blacklist for unfavorable foreign companies.

China says it will release a blacklist of unreliable foreign companies and individuals. Announcement made a day before Beijing is due to increase tariffs on $ 60 billion in U.S. goods. President Donald Trump blacklisted Huawei on grounds of national security on May 16. The move curbs the company's access to components it needs for its equipment.

US President Donald Trump has announced tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico. Mr Trump has declared a national emergency to tackle what he claims is a crisis at the US southern border. Mexico 's top diplomat for North America said the the tariffs would be 'disastrous' The president also took aim at his Democratic opponents, accusing them of a 'total dereliction of duty'

President Trump announced he intends to impose a 5 percent tariff on Mexican imports - potentially rising to 25 percent. Comes as the president is increasingly frustrated with migrants from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras showing up at the U.S. border and seeking asylum. Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Glenn Hamer said the president 's announcement is 'baffling and terribly damaging'

Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he is imposing a 5 percent tariff on all goods coming from Mexico. The president also said that the tariff would continually increase until the issue at the border was resolved. Shortly after the tweets were sent, the White House issued a statement clarifying that the tariffs would go into effect on June 10 and increase on July 1.

The announcement came the same day his administration told Congress it planned to seek congressional approval of a new trade pact with Mexico and Canada. The president has used the threat of tariffs to try to pressure foreign leaders into taking a wide array of actions. It is not clear what legal authority the president would use to issue levies on Mexican immigration.

The new penalties will go into force June 10 and will continue until the illegal migration crisis is alleviated. The president has pursued a hardline approach to migration , both legal and illegal. It is unclear how the duties will affect a trilateral free trade agreement the US agreed to with Canada and Mexico.

Trump to impose new tariffs on all Mexican goods over migrant crisis. Faulting the Mexican government for not doing enough to curb an unprecedented flow of Central American families heading toward the U.S. The move represents Mr. Trump 's latest effort to curtail the large-scale migration of families and unaccompanied children.

U.S. President Donald Trump has rattled the world trade order by imposing unilateral tariffs. The actions led to tit-for-tat retaliation, including a growing tariff war with China. Trump is considering tariffs of around 25 percent on imported cars and auto parts. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement protects Canadian and Mexican production in the event of such tariffs through a quota system.

President Donald Trump said the United States would impose a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods starting next month. He said the sweeping tariffs would rise monthly to as high as 25 percent until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory. The White House said the new tariffs would go into effect on June 10 and would rise by 5 percentage points every month - to 10 percent on July 1 and 15 percent on Aug. 1.

President Trump is imposing 5 % tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico. The tariffs could climb to 25 % within months, if Mexico doesn't do enough to stem the flow of Central Americans into the United States. Mexico is the No. 1 source for imports in about 10 % of government categories. The president has also threatened to place 25% tariffs on all $ 500 billion of imports from China.

The Honourable Chrystia Freeland , Minister of Foreign Affairs, today issued the following statement. Canada has temporarily suspended its operations at the Embassy of Canada to Venezuela. Canada will continue to stand up for the rights of the Venezuelan people and for a full return to democracy in Venezuela.

Canada is temporarily shutting down its embassy in Venezuela. Canada is part of a group of countries who believe Maduro 's re-election last year was fraudulent. Canadian officials have called for him to step down so opposition leader Juan Guaido can take over. Venezuela is in the throes of a historic political and social crisis.

Vice President Mike Pence and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada meet in Ottawa, Canada. The two leaders will discuss the ratification process for the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. They will also discuss the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and the arrest and detention of two Canadian citizens in China.

Juan Guaidó 's VP ( Popular Will in English ) party has instigated violent protests. It took 8 % of the seats in the 2015 elections that saw the opposition win control of the National Assembly. Canadian officials have had significant contact with López 's emissaries and party. The Canadian embassy in Caracas worked with VP officials pushing for the overthrow of the elected government.

Chrystia Freeland is using much of the strategy that brought recent success with the Americans in China. The effect of China slapping Canada down for grabbing Huawei 's Meng Wanzhou was completely unexpected. Freeland said she , and her trade and agriculture colleagues Jim Carr and Marie Claude Bibeau are using much the same strategy.

Venezuela has been rocked by protests since January. President Nicolas Maduro was sworn in for a second term following a vote boycotted by the opposition. Tensions escalated days later when Juan Guaido declared himself acting president. Russia, Turkey, China, Iran, Bolivia and Mexico have thrown their weight behind Maduro.

The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela or commonly known as Venezuela is a South American country that has been decimated by poverty , and is undergoing a political revolution. What has happened under Maduro is a complete disaster with high unemployment , abject poverty all across the country , and hyperinflation. The since democratically elected leader has become one that resembles a totalitarian dictator with reports that his security forces have killed hundreds and disarmament of the populace. President Trump has continued to harshen the rhetoric towards Venezuela and has even said that `` All options are on the table '' regarding the crisis. Trump must steer clear away from Venezuela . We must not enter Venezuela militarily nor should we directly facilitate anything inside Venezuela.

Vice President Mike Pence urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Thursday in Ottawa to engage Cuba directly over its barriers to progress with Venezuela. The vice president confirmed that , during his call with Interim Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó , they spoke about Norway talks. He promised the U.S. will continue to bring pressure to bear on Cuba until the people of Venezuela are free.

Norway praises progress made in talks between Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and opponents. The talks are part of international efforts to resolve a conflict between Maduro and the U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó. The opposition leader declared he was assuming presidential powers in January as head of the opposition-led congress.

The people of Venezuela are suffering from interlocking man-made political and economic crises. Nicolas Maduro came to power in 2013 in a questionable election. Venezuela now ranks 188th out of 190 countries in the World Bank 's Doing Business 2019 '' report. The United States is working alongside the Lima Group to help Venezuelans return their country to prosperity and democracy.

Police raid on Australian Broadcasting Corp ( ABC) has drawn fire from broadcasters and rights groups. Officers arrived at the public broadcaster 's Sydney headquarters with search warrants naming two reporters and the news director. The ABC has protested over the raid and defended the two journalists who were named along with him in the search warrant. The police action is related to articles about alleged misconduct by Australian forces in Afghanistan.

The Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) raided the Sydney offices of the country 's national broadcaster on Wednesday morning. The AFP raided the ABC's Ultimo offices around 11:30 am local time.

YouTube is removing videos that push extremist views like white supremacy. The new policy is an attempt to crack down on hate speech on the Google-owned video service. YouTube did n't specifically say which channels or videos it 's removing. The company has drawn criticism for how it enforces its policies and its decision-making process.

YouTube recommended videos of underage girls after users watched erotic videos, research finds. Researchers at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University were examining YouTube 's impact in Brazil. The study was part of a larger study of the impact of the internet on society.

An analysis of the video platform 's recommendation system showed home movies of kids playing raking in thousands of views because of the sick phenomenon. What had happened was YouTube 's automated recommendation system had pushed the video to other users who had already watched other clips of prepubescent kids. The scientists also found seemingly innocuous family videos were being recommended to users after they 'd watched sexually themed content.

YouTube is taking additional steps to restrict the possibility that children will be targeted by predators on the video platform. YouTube is banning young kids from live-streaming without adult supervision. It is limiting recommendations of videos that depict minors in risky situations. The updated policies come after YouTube in February announced that it would disable the ability to leave comments on nearly all videos featuring kids.

YouTube 's automated recommendation system has gathered a collection of prepubescent , partially-clothed children. While some of the recommendations have been switched off on certain videos, the company has refused to end the practice. YouTube disabled comments on many videos of children in February after an outcry over the comment section.

YouTube 's automated video recommendation system has been allowing otherwise innocent videos of children to be categorized with those preferred by pedophiles. YouTube 's algorithm has been curating home movies of unwitting families into a catalog of semi-nude kids. YT often plays the videos after users watch softcore porn, building an audience of millions for what experts call child sexual exploitation.

Maza wrote a viral Twitter thread last week describing the ongoing anti-gay and racist harassment he is experiencing from right-wing commentator Steven Crowder and his followers. Maza said he and Vox have directly reached out to YouTube for the past two years and have gotten no action at all from them. YouTube did n't immediately respond to BuzzFeed News ' request for comment.

YouTube will update its live streaming policy to prevent minors from live streaming video unless they are clearly accompanied by an adult. The video sharing platform will also automatically disable comments on videos featuring minors. The announcement comes in the aftermath of an NYT investigation that YouTube 's automated recommendation algorithm had begun showing videos that sexualizes children.

YouTube has formally responded to an explosive and controversial feud between Vox writer and video host Carlos Maza and conservative YouTuber Steven Crowder. YouTube says Crowder did not violate any of its policies , and that Crowder 's YouTube channel will stay up. Crowder has routinely made derogatory and mocking remarks about Maza's sexuality and ethnicity when making videos attempting to debunk the Vox video series Strikethrough.

Harvard researcher Jonas Kaiser was researching the effects of YouTube on Brazilian society when he made the disturbing discovery. Kaiser 's research was featured in the New York Times with the headline `` On YouTube 's Digital Playground , An Open Gate For Pedophiles . '' YouTube responded by pointing to a long blog post saying they had disabled comments on videos featuring minors.

Niels Högel was sentenced Thursday to life in prison for the murder of 85 patients. The court in Oldenburg handed down Germany 's most severe form of a life sentence. A prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment can usually apply for parole after 15 years. But if the court judges there is a severe gravity of guilt , parole can be delayed for a non-specified period.

Prosecutors say Niels Högel was drunk on power over his ailing patients. He injected patients with drugs that cause heart failure or circulatory collapse. He then tried to revive them and shine as a saviour before his medical peers and superiors. The dangerous game left at least around 100 patients dead, according to the charges against him.

Niels Hoegel is accused of killing 97 patients aged between 34 and 96 by medical injection in hospitals in the northern cities of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. His horrific killing spree is believed to have begun in 2000 and only stopped when he was caught in the act in 2005. The exhumation and autopsy of more than 130 bodies were necessary to build the case for the prosecution. Police suspect that Hoegal 's final toll may be more than 200 but they say they can never know for sure because of gaps in his memory.

Reporter Who Broke R. Kelly Story: Abuse Was In 'Full View Of The World ' Jim DeRogatis received an anonymous fax in November 2000. He and his writing partner published a story in December 2000 alleging that Kelly had engaged in sex with teenage girls. In February 2002, a videotape purportedly showed Kelly having sex with and urinating on an underage girl.

'' Soulless : The Case Against R. Kelly '' is an essential follow-up read for viewers of the Lifetime documentary. The book is written by Jim DeRogatis , the journalist who has doggedly pursued Kelly 's story since his early days in Chicago. While not all of the revelations are new, the result is similar to the blockbuster Lifetime documentary `` Surviving R . Kelly ''

A former employee testified in front of a federal grand jury late last week. The employee said the disgraced singer paid them a large sum of cash to get back at least one of the tapes. That tape eventually ended up in the hands of Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.

The 11 new counts include four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault. If Kelly is convicted of any one of the four counts, he must go to prison. The first eight counts are from encounters that allegedly occurred between Jan. 1 and Jan. 31, 2010. Three others pertain to alleged encounters between May 1 and May 1, 2009. Kelly's attorney is optimistic that the bail mount wo n't be increased.

I spent almost 20 years reporting on R. Kelly, and nine months trying to find an outlet to publish the story. The story about Kelly 's cult proved more difficult to publish than any in my career. I worked at length with three news organizations, all of which provided additional reporting help.

A former employee testified in front of a federal grand jury late last week saying he was in possession of multiple sex tapes. The employee said the disgraced singer paid them a large sum of cash to get back at least one of the tapes. That tape eventually ended up in the hands of Cook County State 's Attorney Kim Foxx. The ex-employee in question turned over the rest of the videos to federal authorities.

Jim DeRogatis' new book, Soulless, details his investigative reporting of R. Kelly. He broke the stories that were crucial to keeping Kelly 's alleged crimes in the public eye and helped lead to the criminal charges. Kelly was acquitted of all charges in 2008, partially due to the accuser not testifying against the singer.

Soulless : The Case Against R. Kelly by Jim DeRogatis arrives in bookstores the same week that Kelly is scheduled to appear in a Chicago courtroom to face 11 new counts of sexual assault and sexual abuse. The story found him when he was a rock critic for the Chicago Sun-Times , via a fax on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. In 2008, a jury acquitted Kelly of child pornography charges in a case that took six years to come to trial.

R. Kelly has been accused of sexually abusing young women and teenagers for decades. Jim DeRogatis was a music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times in 2000 when he received an anonymous fax tipping him off. He investigated that tip and found that multiple lawsuits had been filed against Kelly. Now he has compiled the results of all his work - nearly 20 years of investigative journalism.

D-Day was the largest military operation ever attempted and marked the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe. It involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of troops on five separate beaches in Normandy. The landings would not have been possible without the support of massive air and naval forces, which were much stronger than the Germans.

Beijing 's top diplomat to Canada blasted the Trudeau government for violating China 's internal affairs.

More than four million Venezuelans have fled their country, UN agencies say. The pace of people fleeing has skyrocketed since the end of 2015, they say. Latin American countries host the vast majority of Venezuelan migrants and refugees. Venezuela 's imploding economy has meant shortages of basic supplies in recent years.

Getting a passport is an expensive and lengthy ordeal for many Venezuelans. Vizcarra made the announcement as he oversaw the deportation of 50 Venezuelans accused of falsifying information to enter the country.

Brazil will not exclude Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co from operating a 5G network. The United States has asked countries to reject Huawei technology in the development of new mobile phone networks. U.S. President Donald Trump raised the issue with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro during a White House visit in March.

Employees of Huawei Technologies wait for a shuttle bus at the 5G testing park inside the telecommunications equipment maker 's headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment. The company is also one of the biggest suppliers of smartphones and tablets.

Sir Michael Fallon said the call was too important to be made in the dying days of the Prime Minister 's tenure. Pushing back the final verdict opens the prospect of the United Kingdom reversing course and following Australia 's lead in banning the Chinese telecommunications giant from the critical 5G mobile network.

ZTE Ushers in Active Involvement with China 's Granting 5G Licences For Commercial Use. China has issued 5G licenses for commercial use on June 6 , 2019. ZTE has been proactively participating in the commercial deployments and construction of 5G networks in China.

China will grant 5G licenses for commercial use on Thursday. China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Broadcasting Network Corp. will be given the licenses. Accelerating the 5G infrastructure is part of Beijing 's efforts to spur domestic economic growth. The move comes amid a race with the U.S. to roll out the next-generation technology.

Sir Michael Fallon said the call was too important to be made in the dying days of the Prime Minister 's tenure. Pushing back the final verdict opens the prospect of the United Kingdom reversing course and following Australia 's lead in banning the Chinese telecommunications giant from the critical 5G mobile network.

China 's industry ministry granted 5G licences to China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Broadcasting Network Corp. Beijing had granted licences at the end of 2018 to China 's three state-owned carriers to conduct 5G trials. This is the first time it has given the go-ahead for full commercial deployment.

Sir Michael Fallon said the call was too important to be made in the dying days of the Prime Minister 's tenure. Pushing back the final verdict opens the prospect of the United Kingdom reversing course and following Australia 's lead in banning the Chinese telecommunications giant from the critical 5G mobile network.

The federal Innovation Ministry released a paper outlining changes to an auction expected next year. The government estimates that 5G wireless technologies could be a C $ 40 billion industry in Canada by 2026. Canada has not yet said whether or not it will use 5G equipment provided by China-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.

President Donald Trump adopted a conciliatory tone this week toward Europe 's approach to Huawei. The US has demanded its allies abandon the Chinese telecom giant over security concerns. Trump had the opportunity during meetings with leaders of the UK and Ireland to badger them about Huawei. He 's instead taken a more cooperative approach.



Boeing learned that a cockpit warning light on its 737 MAX jetliner was defective in 2017. The defective warning light alerts pilots when two sensors that measure the angle between the airflow and the wing disagree. Faulty angle of attack data is suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes involving Boeing 's best-selling 737 MAX.

Boeing discovered a problem in 2017 with a cockpit warning light on the 737 MAX. Boeing decided it would defer an update to fix the issue until 2020, officials said Friday. The company did n't disclose the issue to the Federal Aviation Administration until after a 737 MAX crash in Indonesia last year.

The bull case for Boeing is that the 737 MAX will go back in service sometime within the next year and eventually passengers will abandon their fear of flying in it. The bear case rests on three planks: If Boeing 's reputation has been so badly damaged that passengers will not fly on the 737MAX, airlines will stop flying them. Boeing's profits could decline if 787 manufacturing quality control problems heighten the push by the FAA and other global regulators to take a much tougher stance.

Boeing is in talks with the relatives of people who died in the first of two fatal crashes by its 737 Max jets to explore settling their cases out of court. Ending the lawsuits without a trial would be in Boeing 's interest, multiple lawyers told Business Insider. Settling would let Boeing put the crashes behind them and start focusing on the other things that need to be done, an attorney representing 14 Lion Air families suing Boeing said.

Boeing is in talks with families of people who died in the Lion Air crash to explore settling their cases out of court. A lawyer representing multiple families told Business Insider it is in Boeing 's best interest to settle. Settling would allow Boeing to avoid long, highly publicized trials which could prove damaging for Boeing as its conduct around the crash is scrutinized.

Eight teams have made it past the first knockout stage of the 22nd U-20 World Cup with only three matches standing in their way of lifting the prestigious youth football crown. None of the eight teams in the quarterfinals have previously won the competition meaning that a first-time champion will be crowned. The quarter-finals are set to commence on Friday.

12 nations gathered in China almost three decades ago to compete for what was only subsequently branded as the inaugural Women 's World Cup. The United States beat Norway in the final in front of a crowd of 63,000 , although they only had to play 80-minute games en route to their success. Fifa subsequently granted the women 's game those extra 10 minutes and , by all accounts, ovaries have remained in position ever since.

UAE says a state actor was most likely behind attacks on four tankers off its coast. The 12 May attacks bore the hallmarks of a "sophisticated and co-ordinated operation" The UAE did not say who it thought was behind the attacks, which also targeted vessels from Saudi Arabia and Norway. The US has accused Iran of being behind them but Tehran denies this and has called for investigation.

Saudi Arabia is reportedly expanding both its missile infrastructure and technology with recent purchases from China. Congressional lawmakers worry that the fact the government did not disclose this information in a series of briefings may signal the administration 's tacit approval of the deal. The news comes as tensions between the United States and Iran escalated when Tehran announced its decision to suspend some obligations under the JCPOA.

The Saudi military flew rescue paramedics to the Savis, an Iranian vessel some 95 nautical miles northwest of Yemen 's contested port city of Hodeida. They then flew the injured Iranian to a military hospital in Jizan, a spokesman said. Iran 's mission to the United Nations had made a request to aid the Iranian, he said.

The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Norway will present to the UN Security Council the findings of their probe of the May 12 attacks on oil tankers off the Emirati coast.

Virginia State Senator Richard Black told Sputnik the White House plan to deploy an additional 1,500 troops is based on false pretexts.

Mexico and the United States have agreed on a deal to stop the flow of illegal Central American immigrants from coming into the U.S. The president said the deal suspended steep tariffs on imported Mexican goods that would have gone into effect on Monday. The tariffs raised fears that they could cripple some American businesses and raise prices for American consumers.

The United States and Mexico reached an agreement on immigration enforcement Friday. President Donald Trump said tariffs that were scheduled to hit Mexico on Monday had been indefinitely suspended as a result. Mexico has agreed to deploy its national guard throughout the country with priority given to its southern border to stem migration from Central America.

U.S. refiners warned the Trump administration that tariffs on imports from Mexico could deliver a punishing blow to refiners. Trump surprised Mexico last week with a threat to impose 5 % tariffs on all its exports to the United States. Mexico is a prime supplier of heavy crude , which has been harder to come by since sanctions on Venezuela.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard says his meeting with U.S. officials on Wednesday focused on migration flows and what Mexico is trying to do to slow them. '' Today we do n't discuss the tariffs , '' EBRard told a news conference after his meetings in Washington.

Talks between Mexico and the US on averting the tariffs he threatens to impose unless the southern neighbour stems the flow of undocumented migrants into the US. Trump said some progress -- but not enough -- was made Wednesday in talks. He said that more talks will be held Thursday and that if no deal is reached, the tariffs will go into effect Monday as planned.

Authorities blocked a new caravan of Central American migrants Wednesday after they entered Mexico bound for the United States. Soldiers and police forced hundreds of migrants in the group -- mostly from Honduras -- to a halt in the southern town of Metapa de Dominguez. The National Migration Institute ( INM) said about 420 migrants had been stopped and taken to a detention center by bus. But many others may have fled : state police initially estimated the caravan had some 1,200 people.

Authorities block caravan of around 1,200 Central American migrants after they entered Mexico bound for the United States. Soldiers and police forced the large group of migrants - who were mostly from Honduras - to a halt in the southern town of Metapa de Dominguez. Tension flared as officers brandishing anti-riot shields blocked the migrants ' path. But despite a shoving match , the authorities managed to force the caravan to a stop. Several migrants were detained, but authorities did not immediately say how many or what they planned to do next.

U.S. President Donald Trump says progress is being made in talks with Mexico to stem the flow of migrants to the United States. But unless an agreement can be reached a 5 % tariff on Mexican goods would begin on Monday. " Progress is beingmade , but not nearly enough ! '' Trump said in a post on Twitter.

U.S. refiners warned the Trump administration that tariffs on imports from Mexico could deliver a punishing blow to refiners. The United States imports over 650,000 barrels of crude per day from Mexico. Mexico is a prime supplier of heavy crude , which has been harder to come by since the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela in January.

The trade war between the U.S. and China is already affecting businesses in western Massachusetts. CRRC is a China-based rail car manufacturing company. Their North American headquarters is located on Page Boulevard in Springfield. The new tariffs on Chinese goods will significantly increase the cost of manufacturing rail cars.

US officials officially granted Chinese exporters two more weeks to get their products into the United States before increasing tariffs on those items. The United States Trade Representative had earlier announced the planned move on May 31. The Trump administration had raised its 10 percent levy on Chinese imports to 25 percent as it sought to pressure Beijing.

U.S. officials list $ 300 billion more of Chinese goods for possible tariff hikes. Chinese authorities were reacting to President Donald Trump 's surprise decision last week to impose punitive duties on $ 200 billion of imports from China. Beijing announced tariff hikes Monday on $ 60 billion of American goods in their spiraling dispute over Chinese technology ambitions.

China announces it is raising tariffs on $ 60 billion of U.S. goods. The new penalty duties of 5 % to 25 % will take effect June 1. That followed Trump 's increase on Friday of duties on $ 200 billion of Chinese imports. Forecasters have warned that the U.s. tariff hikes could disrupt a Chinese recovery.

President Donald Trump 's latest tariff hike on Chinese goods took effect Friday and Beijing said it would retaliate. The increase went ahead even after American and Chinese negotiators began more talks in Washington aimed at ending a dispute. The two countries are sparring over U.S. allegations Beijing steals technology and pressures companies to hand over trade secrets.

Until now, the economy has largely shrugged off damage from Trump 's trade wars. The new tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports amount to potentially $ 190 billion a year in new taxes. Researchers at UBS calculate that a 25 % tariff on all Chinese imports would shave a full percentage point from U.S. growth.

The longer the US trade war with China continues , the more it will affect small businesses. Almost half or 43 % of small business owners said the Chinese tariffs is increasing their costs. For 64 % of these owners it means raising prices in order to stay afloat. The rest will take different measures to keep their business running without losing customers.

Vietnam says it will impose higher penalties on Chinese goods illegally relabeled as made-in-Vietnamese. The customs department has detected dozens of fraudulent certificates of product origin. Vietnam 's exports to the U.S. have surged this year at the same time that China 's shipments to America have slumped.

Vatican releases 31-page teaching guidance titled Male and Female He Created Them. Criticises modern understanding of gender as being more complex than the binary division of sexes. Document has drawn immediate criticism from LGBT groups. It is not signed by Pope Francis himself, but quotes him and scripture within its reasoning.

Labour MP Roger Godsiff will be given a dressing down by the party 's chief whip. He told campaigners protesting against LGBT teaching at a Birmingham school: 'You're right' The LGBT Labour group has called for veteran MP Mr Godsiff to lose the Labour whip. Weeks of megaphone-led protests at the Birmingham school saw the council successfully apply for a High Court interim injunction.

Millennials and post-millennials are engaged in a far-reaching discussion about gender. A 2015 survey of a thousand 13- to 20-year olds in the U.S. reported that 56 percent knew someone who used gender-neutral pronouns such as " ze" A quarter of California young people identify as gender nonconforming.

Gender and sexual diversity can be understood from several perspectives. These include biological or physical sex - what we see or can measure; gender identity - how people identify independently of their biological sex; and sexual orientation. All elements contribute to a person 's gender expression - how they live their lives. When gender identity does not correlate to physical sexual characteristics, this may result in transgenderism.

Vatican rejects gender change to alarm of LGBT Catholics. LGBT Catholics immediately denounced it as harmful and contributing to hatred. Advocacy group New Ways Ministry said it will confuse people who are struggling with questions about gender identity. The Vatican also insists on the sexual complementarity of men and women.



Rep. Justin Amash quit the conservative House Freedom Caucus on Monday night. Amash had become the lone Republican to call for President Donald Trump 's impeachment. The Michigan lawmaker said he did not want to be a further distraction for the group. The 39-year-old libertarian rode the 2010 tea party wave to Congress.

Some argue that impeaching Trump and removing him before 2020 election would be unwise, says Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: But to think of the House of Representatives as akin to a prosecutor or grand jury is misguided. House can conduct an impeachment inquiry that ends with a verdict and not just a referral to the Senate for trial, he says.

Zelizer: But to think of the House of Representatives as akin to a prosecutor or grand jury is misguided. House can conduct an impeachment inquiry that ends with a verdict and not just a referral to the Senate for trial, he says.

Democrats in House wrestle with impeachment question. Many feel caught between party leaders fearful that impeachment will spark a political backlash. And there are the die-hards determined to press for the ouster of a president they consider a singular threat to the republic. This account of the unfolding drama is based on interviews over with past week with 45 Democrats.

Jennifer Rubin: Nancy Pelosi says impeachment doesn't mean you're out of office. She says we've never removed a president after impeachment and trial in the Senate. Rubin: Congress can achieve the same result by holding hearings on obstruction of justice. She suggests a multistep process, starting with a speech from the floor.

David Rothkopf: It's possible to argue that impeaching Trump would be unwise. He says impeachment power is a vital constitutional safeguard against a dangerous president. But he says the Senate is legally free to engage in politics in arriving at its verdict. House can conduct an impeachment inquiry that ends with a verdict and not just a referral, he says.

Trump violated an oath he made when he took office by posting to Facebook videos promoting his visit to his Doonbeg golf course. The videos were removed after HuffPost began making inquiries about them. Trump had no official business scheduled in Ireland when the itinerary was created. The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington say that Trump's abuse of taxpayer funding and mixing of business and his role as president is not without precedent.

Michigan Republican Congressman Justin Amash made headlines Saturday by declaring on Twitter that President Trump deserved impeachment. A review of Amash 's financial interests quickly reveals a very personal business motive. His family tool business is heavily invested in Chinese manufacturing. The media was quick to promote his position and advance an anti-Trump narrative.

The impeachment storm is gathering force around the West Wing again after two-time former FBI director Robert S Mueller III spoke publicly for the first time recently since his appointment in 2017. The former Marine concluded his speech by clearly stating that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election. Mueller provided enough ammo to the Democrats for launching a blitzkrieg on Trump.

Dionne: In a more virtuous political world, Republicans would investigate Mueller report. He says in a functioning republic, Congress and the White House would be dealing with actual problems. But the Trump presidency puts problem-solving on hold, he says. Dionne: Democrats should publicly time-limit their forbearance on stonewalling.



Canada will ban single-use plastics as early as 2021 in a bid to reduce ocean waste. The initiative is modelled on similar legislation passed last year by the European Union and other nations. Canada will also establish targets for companies that manufacture or sell plastics to be responsible for their plastic waste.

Justin Trudeau says Canada committed genocide against Indigenous women and girls. The Organization of American States says it expects Canada to cooperate with its investigation. Justin Trudeau is now the first Canadian Prime Minister to be investigated for state-sponsored mass murder by an international body in which Canada is a member state.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will announce steps towards a federal ban on single-use plastics on Monday. A government official said the ban would take effect as early as 2021. U.K. prime minister Theresa May announced last year that her government would ban plastic straws, cotton swabs and other one-off items.

Plastic straws, cotton swabs, drink stirrers, plates, cutlery and balloon sticks will be banned. This is part of a larger strategy to tackle the plastic pollution problem that the government is expected to announce Monday. The full list of plastics to be banned will follow the model chosen by the European Union.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's Liberal government on Monday will lay out plans to regulate plastic waste. The move is part of a national blueprint to reduce the amount of hard-to-recycle consumer packaging. The EU moved in March to ban 10 single-use items, including plastic cutlery , plates and Styrofoam food and drink containers.

The Liberal government will announce on Monday that it intends to ban single-use plastics by 2021. The move follows a vote last fall by the European Union 's parliament. The exact products that will be banned in Canada will be determined after public consultations. An estimated 150 million tonnes of discarded plastics are dumped into oceans worldwide annually.

The federal government will announce a plan Monday to ban harmful single-use plastics. A government official with knowledge of the plan says no list of banned products will be unfurled immediately. The idea is to come up with a comprehensive plan to ban the sale and use of toxic plastic products within a couple of years.

A fishing boat carrying more than 60 Rohingya Muslims was found beached on an island in southern Thailand on Tuesday. The passengers - 28 men , 31 women and five children - were stranded on Rawi island in Tarutao National Park in Thailand 's southern Satun province. Scores of Rohingya Muslims have boarded boats in recent months to try to reach Malaysia.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has reportedly accused Myanmar of being hesitant in repatriating over a million Rohingya who fled ongoing sectarian conflict in the northern Rakhine State. The Prime Minister also feared that some international aid and voluntary agencies too were unwilling to resolve the crisis. Myanmar stripped the Muslim-majority Rohingya of their citizenship in 1982 , rendering them stateless.

PM Hasina also expressed concerns about security factors involving Rohingyas as many were found to be engaged in criminal activities. She further noted that Dhaka had separately held talks with India, China and Japan over their stance on the Rohingya crisis. All the three countries had acknowledged Rohingya as Myanmar nationals and agreed that they should return home.

Internal displacements continued to increase across Rakhine State. WFP continued to provide emergency food assistance to 43,720 displaced people in 12 townships in Kachin State. The National School Feeding Multi-Sectoral Technical Coordination Group met to discuss ways to increase food and nutrition assistance to young students across Myanmar.

'The problem lies with Myanmar as they do n't want to take back the Rohingyas by any means though Naypyidaw signed an agreement with Bangladesh promising to repatriate them,' Sheikh Hasina said. She also feared that some international aid and voluntary agencies too were unwilling to resolve the crisis saying, 'They never want the refugees to return to their home . ''

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has slammed Myanmar for delays in repatriation of Rohingya refugees. Some 740,000 Rohingya took shelter in squalid camps in Bangladesh after Myanmar 's military drove them over the border in a 2017 crackdown. The two governments signed a repatriation deal in November 2017 , yet so far virtually no Rohingya have volunteered to return.

President Donald Trump says Kim Jong Un has kept his word to him on missile testing.

The House Oversight Committee voted Wednesday to recommend the full House hold Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress. President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over materials related to the committee 's census investigation. The privilege assertion marks the latest escalation in the battle between the Trump Administration and House Democrats investigating Ross ' move to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

House Oversight Committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings has set a time on Wednesday for his committee to vote on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress. It follows a previous vote last month which in which the committee held Barr in contempt for refusing to provide Congress with the full report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

It 's unclear if the deal will ultimately be enough for Democrats. But it signaled the first real breakthrough in the standoff over the report.

Dean testified Monday that Mueller has provided Congress with a road map for investigating Trump.

The House expects to receive the first files of underlying evidence from Robert Mueller 's report as soon as Monday. It's unclear if the deal announced Monday will produce the kind of documents Democrats want to see from the special counsel 's work. But it signaled the first real breakthrough in the standoff over the report and came at the start of a week of ramped up action by the House.

The U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee plans to vote on Wednesday. If the committee finds them in contempt , a vote could then take place in the full House.

Sanders will leave the job at the end of June to return to her home state of Arkansas. She is the latest in a long line of senior advisers to leave the White House.

U.S. President Donald Trump spoke over phone with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Iran and bilateral trade. Abe paid a visit to Iran earlier this week, which was the first visit made by a Japanese prime minister since Takeo Fukuda in 1978. Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Abe on Thursday that it was meaningless to exchange message with Trump.

President Donald Trump said it is too early even to consider entering negotiations with Iran. Trump said that while he appreciated a mediating mission by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , it was too soon to even think about making a deal. "They are not ready , and neither are we!" he said.

Could Japan be Trump 's next trade war victim ? Despite Japan 's apparent warm relationship with Trump , he still wants to show voters that he is aggressively renegotiating all trade agreements. Despite Japan's apparent warm relationships with Trump, he still want to show Voters he is aggressive renegotiating trade deals.

President Donald Trump on Thursday said that the United States and Iran are not ready to strike a deal to end their longstanding conflict. He also praised Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who has offered to broker a deal between Tehran and Washington. This comes hours after two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman , raising tensions in the region.

President Donald Trump said it is too early even to consider entering negotiations with Iran. Trump said while he appreciated a mediating mission by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. "They are not ready , and neither are we ! '' he said of Iran's nuclear program. "I personally feel that it's too soon to even think about making a deal ," he said.

The president 's first event after arriving in Tokyo was a reception with several dozen Japanese and American business leaders. He said the two countries are hard at work '' negotiating a trade agreement. Trump and Abe planned to play golf Sunday before Abe gives Trump the chance to present his President 's Cup trophy to the winner of a sumo wrestling championship match.

The Associated Press reported erroneously that spectators at sumo matches sometimes throw seat cushions when they are disappointed with the outcome. Cushions are tossed to praise the winner of a tough fight or in response to an upset match. A corrected version of the story is below: Sumo diplomacy: Abe courts Trump with burgers, golf, more Sumo-sized diplomacy.

Ayatollah Khamenei categorically rejected the possibility of talks between Iran and the US in a meeting with Japan 's prime minister. He said the US president does not merit a response or exchange of messages with Iran. Abe expressed the hope that political negotiations in Tehran would pave the way for the promotion of cooperation between Japan and Iran.

The president and prime minister tried mightily to minimize their differences during Trump 's four-day state visit to Tokyo. The conflict demonstrates the limits of Abe 's long-term strategy of showering Trump with affection. Trump also demonstrated again that he is willing to turn his back on long-held norms as he assailed Joe Biden.

President Donald Trump says he has a good feeling about getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Speaking Monday alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Trump said the U.S. has come a long way with North Korea. Trump is the first world leader to meet Naruhito since he ascended to the throne on May 1. Trump opened a four-day state visit to Japan on Saturday.



Yemen 's Houthi movement launched fresh drone attacks targeting Jizan and Abha airports. Saudi-led coalition said it intercepted and downed a Houthi drone targeting the southwestern city of Abha. The Houthis have stepped up missile and drone attacks against Saudi cities as tensions rise.

Malaysia strongly condemns the missile attack on the Abha International Airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia. Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement today said the attack is an unacceptable violation of international law and detrimental to the peace and security of the Middle East. No Malaysians were reported to be affected by the incident.

Yemen 's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said early on Friday that it carried out drone attacks on Abha Airport. There was no Saudi confirmation of the attacks. The Saudi-led military coalition vowed to respond firmly to a Wednesday cruise missile attack by Yemeni Houthi forces on the airport.

Saudi Arabia has yet to confirm the attack, according to reports. The Saudi-led coalition confirmed on Wednesday that 26 people were injured as a result of the missile. The missile attack followed an incident in which Saudi Arabia 's air defense forces had intercepted two drones launched by insurgents from the Ansar Allah movement.

Senators hope to force a vote on U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia. Anger has been mounting in Congress over the Trump administration 's close ties to the Saudis. Tensions were further inflamed when Trump used an emergency declaration in May to sell the kingdom weapons that Congress had previously placed on hold.

Saudi Arabia 's air defence forces intercepted five drones launched by Yemen 's Houthis. The air traffic and air space at Abha airport were operating normally. Houthi-run Masirah TV reported earlier that the Iran-aligned movement had carried out drone attacks on Abha Airport.

Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are banding together to introduce more than a dozen resolutions aimed at blocking the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia. The maneuver amounts to a remarkable display of bipartisan pushback to Trump 's foreign policy and threatens to tangle the Senate in a series of floor votes this summer. Anger has been mounting in Congress over the Trump administration 's close ties to the Saudis.

Three Turkish soldiers were lightly wounded when 35 mortar rounds were fired at the observation point. The attack came amid a ground offensive launched by Syrian government forces in late April. Al-Qaida linked militants and other jihadi groups have come to dominate the Idlib enclave. The Russian military had a different version of events on Thursday , blaming militants for the attack.

Channel 4 debate attracted an audience of 1.3 million and 7.8 % of the audience share. Four of the five candidates argued over whether Parliament should be prorogued. Dominic Raab said he would be prepared to try and suspend parliament if it was the only way to get the UK out without a deal.

Deutsche Bank analysts note that in the UK , we did have the first Conservative Party leadership contest which revealed overwhelming support for Boris Johnson. Johnson took 114 votes with Jeremy Hunt a reasonable way back in second place at 43 votes. Gove, Raab, Javid, Hancock and Stewart all made it through to the next round which is due to take place next Tuesday.

Boris Johnson says it is 'perfectly realistic' to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement. Former foreign secretary says he is committed to leaving the EU by October 31. He denies using cocaine since a 'single inconclusive event' more than 30 years ago. Health Secretary Matt Hancock withdraws from the Tory leadership race.

Johnson secured 114 of the 313 votes cast by Conservatives in the House of Commons. Jeremy Hunt trailed with 43 votes, followed by Environment Secretary Michael Gove with 37. Three candidates were eliminated after failing to reach the threshold of 17 votes needed to get to the next round. The winner will become the new Conservative Party leader and Britain 's next prime minister.

Boris Johnson has secured the most support in the first round of votes in Britain 's Conservative Party leadership race. Johnson got 114 votes in the secret ballot among more than 300 Conservative lawmakers. Seven contenders remain in the contest to succeed Theresa May as party leader and prime minister. Further elimination votes will be held next week until just two candidates remain.

If Boris Johnson succeeds in his gallop towards Downing Street, his elevation will present a heightened foreign policy challenge for the Government. But it will not necessarily be a doomsday scenario, writes Lord Tebbit. Johnson's eulogising of the British empire and attempts to portray his hero Winston Churchill as hostile to European co-operation are dishonest as they are irritating.

The populist is former Boris Johnson, who ran London as mayor for eight years until 2016. The pragmatist is International Development Secretary Rory Stewart. The 313 Conservative lawmakers will start the process of narrowing the field down to two. The winner, due to be chosen by late July, will become Conservative leader and prime minister.

The Syrian town of Beit Jinn is now a striking example of how life in the area has changed. The town was reported as a strategic stronghold of armed militants just 18 months ago. The former head of the town administration, Haisam Hammudi, met Sputnik correspondents at the entrance to the town. He had fled to the Golan Heights with his family and several hundred other fellow villagers in 2014.

The 'Deal of the Century ' is going to be the 'Three Months Deal ' aimed to ensure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be reelected. UN senior diplomats and established reporters in Washington share this view. In off the record talks it is seen as a natural White House reaction to the Netanyahu failure to come up with a collation. Even if Netanyahu wins the re-do elections and forms a coalition , Israel would only have a working government able to discuss such a peace plan in October.

Brad Parscale, the 43-year-old digital marketing guru credited with putting Donald Trump in the White House in 2016 and now charged with keeping him there for another four years, moved his family from Texas to south Florida in January. Parscale said he made the move to Fort Lauderdale to shorten his commute between Washington , DC , and his home in San Antonio - from where in 2016 he orchestrated the most costly , complex and stunning upsets in American politics. Because Florida is one of a handful of states with no income tax , Parscale can avoid paying the progressive income tax in Washington , D.C.

China seismic network claimed it was caused by a suspected explosion, but did not give further details. News comes as Chinese President Xi is set to pay a two-day state visit to North Korea.

A 1.3-magnitude earthquake with a zero metre depth occurred at 7.38 pm ( 12.38pm Irish time ) in Hunchun city in northeastern Jilin province. It was unclear what caused the explosion. In the past , nuclear tests by Pyongyang have caused tremors and mini quakes around the northern border China shares with North Korea.

The tremor was felt in Hunchun city in northeastern Jilin province. The depth and nature of the mini quake has led many to think it was caused by an explosion on North Korean soil. In September 2017 , a test conducted at North Korea 's nuclear site at Punggye-ri triggered a 6.3-magnitude earthquake.

China detected a 1.3 magnitude earthquake in a city bordering North Korea on Monday. Shallow earthquakes may be triggered by powerful explosions such as a nuclear test. Previous nuclear tests from North Korea set off similar earthquakes in bordering cities in China. It's unclear, however, if the earthquake on Monday is the result of similar nuclear-related activities in North Korea.

U.S. sending 1,000 troops to Middle East amid heightened tension with Iran Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan cited recent tensions with Iran as a potential threat to United States interests across the region. He said the move was in response to the Iranian government's actions in the past.

The move comes just days after the attacks on the oil tankers in one of the world 's most important shipping routes. The U.S. says the attacks were carried out by Iran 's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Last week, the Pentagon released footage purporting to show an Iranian vessel affixing an unexploded mine to a tanker.

Saudi Arabia on Saturday blamed Iran for attacks on its oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Two tankers were attacked on Thursday, while four others had been targeted off the coast of the United Arab Emirates last month. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said the Iranian regime did not respect the Japanese prime minister 's visit to Tehran.

Saudi Arabia on Saturday blamed Iran for attacks on its oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Two tankers were attacked on Thursday, while four others had been targeted off the coast of the United Arab Emirates last month. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said the Iranian regime did not respect the Japanese prime minister 's visit to Tehran.

Two large tankers were hit by explosions in the Sea of Oman on Thursday. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hastily accused Iran of carrying out the attacks without providing any evidence to back up his accusation. In this regard, Iran rejected Pompeo 's anti-Iran accusations, saying the suspicious nature of the recent attacks on two oil tankers is alarming. An interview was done with Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher Anthony Cartalucci.

The United Kingdom decided to send 100 marines to the Persian Gulf region in order to protect its military and merchant vessels. On Thursday, two oil tankers suffered explosions and fires in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz. The United States and the United Kingdom accuse Iran of attacking the tankers. Tehran refuted the accusations.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the UK ambassador in Tehran over London 's recent remarks on alleged Iranian involvement in the recent incident in the Gulf of Oman. On Friday, the UK Foreign Office accused the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of attacking tankers. A day earlier, the similar remarks were made by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Saudi on Sunday accused of carrying out the attack on two in the Gulf of earlier this week. The targetted tankers were carrying `` Japan-related cargo '' The incident occurred at a time when Japanese was on an official visit to Iran. Shortly after the incident, the US had pinned the blame on the Islamic Republic. The allegation was immediately denounced by Iranian.

The Kokuka Courageous was carrying highly flammable methanol through the Gulf of Oman on Thursday when it came under attack along with the Norwegian-operated Front Altair. US President Donald Trump has said the twin attacks had Iran `` written all over it '' -- rejecting Tehran 's vehement denial -- and its key Gulf ally Saudi Arabia has also lashed out against Tehran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in remarks published Sunday he would not hesitate to tackle any threats to the oil-rich kingdom.

US President Donald Trump is not convinced the Iran nuclear deal is having the desired effect. The US also has a strong interest in avoiding any disruption to the global oil trade. Saudi Arabia has long been wary of Iran expanding its influence in the Middle East. Iran has used the war in Syria to establish a permanent military presence in the country.



A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Tuesday appeared inclined to uphold a lower court order that gave details on the minimum necessities that must be provided to undocumented immigrant children being held by the government. The order was issued in 2017 by U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee of Los Angeles. Gee ordered officials to provide soap, toothbrushes and showers and to end an alleged practice of having children sleep on concrete floors under an aluminum blanket in cold , noisy and constantly lighted rooms.

The Trump administration went to court this week to argue that migrant children detained at the United States-Mexico border do not require basic hygiene products like soap and toothbrushes. The administration argued that requiring minors to sleep on cold concrete floors in crowded cells with low temperatures similarly fulfilled that requirement. At least seven migrant children have died in U.S. custody since late 2018.

Panel hears case on conditions for young migrants on border. U.S. government lawyer says a settlement agreement requiring sanitary conditions for detained immigrant children may not necessarily mean a toothbrush and soap must be provided for shorter stays. The hearing focused on the Department 's appeal of a 2017 court ruling finding authorities breached the longstanding agreement. Young immigrants caught on the southwest border said they had to sleep in cold , overcrowded cells.

Dominic Raab knocked out of Tory leadership race in latest ballot of MPs. Boris Johnson came top of the ballot with 126 votes - 12 more than in first round. Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart also got enough votes. Next ballot will take place on Wednesday with candidate with lowest number of votes eliminated.

Dominic Raab refused to rule out suspending the UK parliament to push through Brexit by the end of October. In the first televised debate of the campaign, the five candidates all agreed the next prime minister had to take Britain out of the EU. But there were sharp differences as to how that could be achieved. Channel 4 put an empty podium for frontrunner Boris Johnson who refused to take part.

The six contenders vying to become Britain 's next prime minister held a leadership hustings on Saturday with rival candidates aiming their fire at frontrunner Boris Johnson. The men battling for the leadership of the governing centre-right Conservative Party spoke at a central London hotel. The contenders were warming up their arguments ahead of a 90-minute televised debate on Sunday.

When Boris Johnson gave his friend David Cameron just ten minutes ' notice that he was backing Leave in the EU Referendum, a serious rift opened up. I now hear that Cameron is quietly advising Boris on his Tory leadership campaign. Could Boris be trying to persuade Cameron to take a seat in the House of Lords and serve in his Cabinet ? Incidentally, there is no sign of a thaw in Cameron 's relations with Michael Gove , whom he 's yet to forgive for backing Brexit. Is Tory leadership hopeful Rory Stewart at risk of sabotaging himself with mixed messages ?

Four of the five candidates said they would seek to renegotiate the draft divorce deal agreed with Brussels. The fifth, Rory Stewart, said he would press ahead with the current agreement. Stewart is the candidate with the lowest number of endorsements from fellow Conservative MPs. The survivors of the second round on Tuesday will face a BBC television debate later the same day.

Boris Johnson has won the much sought-after endorsement of former Tory leadership candidate Matt Hancock. The health secretary announced he would be backing Mr Johnson in the next round of voting by MPs this week. Mr Johnson was attacked by his rivals for snubbing the first TV debate. The other significant post-debate endorsement went to Rory Stewart.

Several hopefuls vying to replace British Prime Minister Theresa May turned their fire on favourite Boris Johnson. They questioned his pledge to leave the European Union by the end of October no matter what. At a Channel 4 debate, his absence was marked by an empty lectern.

Boris Johnson emerges unscathed from a television debate that failed to scrutinise his pledge to take the UK out of the European Union without a Brexit deal. His five rivals in the C4 debate - the first in a contest set to conclude in July - largely refrained from attacking him in his absence. Only Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - seen as one of the likeliest eventual challengers - went on the attack.

Boris Johnson refused to take part in a televised debate alongside his five rivals Sunday. Channel 4 left an empty lectern on the debate stage for Johnson. Johnson has a commanding lead after last week 's first round of voting by Tory lawmakers. The final two names will be put to a postal vote of about 160,000 Conservative members.



Sergio Moro discordou de investigações sobre o ex-presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso na Lava Jato. O diálogo ocorreu em 13 de abril de 2017, um dia depois do Jornal Nacional ter veiculado uma reportagem a respeito de suspeitas contra o tucano. Moro chamou Deltan Dallagnol em um chat privado no Telegram. O procurador respondeu acreditar that a força-tarefa - por meio de seu braço em Brasília - proposital

Operation Lava Jato was protecting high profile centre-right politicians such as US-backed former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The Intercept reveals that they pretended to investigate ex-President Cardoso while ignoring evidence that his own foundation collected illegal donations from Odebrecht subsidiary Braskem. The propaganda around LavaJato is befitting an official enemy rather than friendly nation.

The Intercept posted purported chats between then-judge Sergio Moro and ex-prosecutor. Moro offered strategy advice to the prosecutor in the corruption case against Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The conviction ended da Silva 's 2018 presidential run and Moro went on to become justice minister. The Brazilian Bar Association has called for the suspension of the minister.

Abba Moro has commended Alhaji Usman Abubakar , a senatorial candidate of Advance Peoples Democratic Alliance ( APDA ) for withdrawing the petition challenging his election. Moro gave the commendation in a chat with newsmen shortly after he attended the sitting of the National and State Assembly election petition tribunal in Makurdi.

Glenn Greenwald is now directing critical attention to Brazil 's justice minister, Sergio Moro. Moro is accused of conspiring to keep former President Lula da Silva out of the 2018 presidential race. Lula is serving a reduced jail term of eight years and 10 months after being convicted of accepting a seaside apartment as a bribe.

Sérgio Moro was the most prominent judge overseeing the vast corruption probe that upturned the country 's political order. Now, after the publication of alleged private chats with prosecutors in the probe, Moro is in the uncomfortable position he 'd put so many others through. Analysts say they could come to tarnish the broader corruption investigation, Operation Car Wash.

Brazil 's Car Wash Investigation Faces New Pressures. Investigators must now face the question of whether they can still achieve their aims. A Supreme Federal Court increasingly divided over questions about the investigation 's judicial autonomy. Together with allegations of political bias , these factors could force the investigation closer to its demise.

A new leaked conversation by The Intercept shows current Supreme Justice Minister Sergio Moro while serving as a judge in the Car Wash ( Lava Jato ) directed the prosecutors ' media strategy against former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The Intercept Brazil published on Sunday an extensive and hard-hitting exposé on the alleged political motivations behind Operation Car Wash against Lula. The documents were released in a three-part series.

Brazil's Justice Minister Sergio Moro says he has nothing to hide regarding allegedly leaked personal messages. Moro told a Senate committee in Brasilia that some of the messages attributed to him could have been doctored. He suspects organized crime is behind the alleged hacking, Moro said.

Sergio Moro says he has nothing to hide regarding allegedly leaked personal messages with prosecutors. Moro has come under pressure after messages allegedly show he advised prosecutors to influence public opinion against the leftist leader. He said some of the messages attributed to him may have been deliberately doctored to generate a scandal.



US President Donald Trump announces his choice for defence secretary has withdrawn. Patrick Shanahan will be replaced by Army Secretary Mark Esper. It comes as Mr Shanahan publicly addressed allegations of domestic violence. His decision will extend what is already the longest period of time the US has been without a confirmed defence secretary.

President Donald Trump announced acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan as his pick to get the Pentagon job on a permanent basis. But the White House has yet to formally nominate Shanahan, forcing the Senate Armed Services Committee to postpone a confirmation hearing. Senators were told that the postponement was because the committee had yet to receive documents from the FBI 's background check. With Shanahan 's confirmation on hold, press reports have questioned his relationship with the president.

The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, is a lucrative deal that would bolster the company run by the world 's wealthiest man , Jeff Bezos. The sweetheart deal has come under significant scrutiny in recent weeks, as new documents and information has shed light on potential serious corruption. The Pentagon 's Inspector General is now investigating the deal. A report from NBC News suggests that President Trump is having second thoughts about his choice for his next secretary of defense.

Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan's Senate hearing delayed until at least next month. The Senate Armed Services Committee had tentatively scheduled a hearing for Tuesday June 18. With Shanahan 's confirmation on hold, press reports have questioned his relationship with the president. Shanahan's ex-wife was arrested and charged for domestic violence before his divorce.

President Donald Trump has placed acting officials in key posts in significantly higher numbers than his recent predecessors. The practice lets him quickly, if temporarily, install allies in important positions while circumventing the Senate confirmation process. The latest example is Ken Cuccinelli, who last week was named acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Patrick Shanahan and his then-wife both claimed to the police that they had been punched by the other. The incident did not surface when Trump nominated Shanahan to be the Pentagon 's second-in-command. The episode could be a potential roadblock for Shanahan if Trump formally nominates him for the secretary 's post.

Patrick Shanahan released a written statement Monday night addressing a violent domestic dispute from nine years ago with his then-wife. The 2010 incident is part of an FBI background investigation ahead of his possible confirmation hearing to be President Trump 's permanent defense chief. The full statement: "It is unfortunate that such a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up"

President Trump announced on Twitter Tuesday that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will withdraw from the confirmation process. He will name Secretary of the Army Mark Esper to be his acting replacement. The shakeup at the Pentagon comes amid escalating tensions with Iran. Yesterday, Shanahan announced that the U.S. will send 1,000 troops to the Middle East.

Shanahan withdraws his nomination as acting defense secretary. Army Secretary Esper will be new acting secretary. Trump: Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan withdraws nomination. Shanahan: I will continue to work with the Department of Defense on issues of national security and national defense. Shanahan's nomination was withdrawn on Tuesday.

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has removed his name from consideration for the permanent position. It 's a significant shake-up as the U.S. faces increasing tensions with Iran. Shanahan was in the role less than six months. Secretary of the Army Mark Esper will be the new Acting Secretary of Defense.



Senator and 2020 contender criticized Trump for not discussing the climate emergency at his 'Keep America Great ' campaign launch.

Trump said he would talk about the issue at a future event in the state.

US President Donald Trump formally launched his 2020 re-election campaign on Tuesday in front of a large crowd in Orlando, Florida. The announcement comes amid calls for impeachment, continuing congressional probes into his presidency and administration and deepening divisions over his hardline immigration policies. But Trump 's speech also comes as the economy continues to grow and the Republican president maintains deep support among his base.

The president continued to host sporadic campaign-style rallies over the next year. The point of a campaign launch used to be to signal that the period of governing-of passing legislation and enacting policy-was largely wrapping up. The problem with skating from crisis to crisis with few accomplishments is that eventually the public becomes fatigued.

Trump campaign fires multiple pollsters after unflattering numbers leak. President lagging behind Democratic presidential candidates in key states, according to multiple sources. CNN and other outlets first reported the numbers weeks ago, but a purge of the polling team was proposed after Trump grew angry about coverage of the numbers in recent days.

Four years later : Trump 's 2020 campaign is more traditional but still familiar. Many key players from Trump's first campaign are largely absent for his second round. Trump is seeking a bigger, better and badder '' second round than he did in 2008. He is expected to face off against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.

Trump would take foreign 'oppo . ' Top election cop wants to be '100 % clear ' that 's illegal . The Federal Election Commission chair issued a statement after President Donald Trump said he might accept dirt on an opponent from a foreign government. Trump said in a speech that he would accept dirt from an opponent.

Fox poll shows Biden leading Trump by 49 per cent to 39 per cent among all registered voters nationwide. A separate survey of key battleground states shows Democrats strongly favour Biden as the candidate most likely to beat Trump in next year 's elections. While the latest polling news proved heartening to Democrats, the Trump re-election campaign reportedly has cut ties to three of its own pollsters.

An MSNBC panel speculated that one of the things President Donald Trump will do when he announces his reelection campaign this week is run a rerun of 2016. The Washington Post 's Bob Costa said that since the 2018 election , Trump has claimed that he has the magic formula for the GOP and Republicans that lost did so because they ran from him and his policies. Costa said the Trump campaign admit that they see numbers dip , but they think there is still a path to victory in 2020 by stoking their own base.

In November 2016, President Donald Trump defied the pundits by winning Michigan. On Tuesday, the 2020 Donald J. Trump for President campaign will officially get underway with a rally in Florida. Laura Cox, chair of the Michigan Republican Party, says Michigan's 16 electoral votes will be absolutely decisive this time around.

Democrats are n't ceding the Sunshine State. Democratic candidates have already visited to tap donors and connect with voters. Trump will return on Tuesday for his latest reelection announcement at a rally in Orlando. For Trump , there are few ways for him to remain in the White House without keeping Florida 's 29 electoral votes.



International Consolidated Airlines Group signed a letter of intent at the Paris Air Show to order 200 Boeing 737 Max planes. The vote of confidence from British Airways ' parent sent shares of the manufacturer sharply higher. Boeing shares surged 5.4 % to close at $ 373.96 , outpacing the broader market and leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg says company made a mistake in handling cockpit warning system. U.S. Federal Aviation Administration faulted Boeing for not telling regulators for more than year that a safety indicator in the Max cockpit did n't work. Two deadly crashes of the top-selling plane occurred in 2007 and 2008.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg says the company made a mistake in handling a cockpit warning system in its 737 Max jets. The US Federal Aviation Administration has faulted Boeing for not telling regulators for more than a year that a safety indicator in the cockpit of the top-selling plane did n't work as intended. Pilots also have expressed anger that Boeing did not inform them about the new software that 's been implicated in the fatal crashes.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg will be at the Paris Air Show this week. He is trying to reassure airlines and industry partners over the fate of its 737 MAX plane. The popular jet is indefinitely grounded after two fatal crashes. Aviation regulators were unable to determine when the popular jet might again be allowed to fly.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg promised transparency as the company works to get the grounded plane back in flight. Boeing believed that the light was operational on all the jets when it began delivering the Max to airlines in 2017. But after the Max began flying that year , Boeing engineers learned that the warning light would work only if a carrier had purchased a separate cockpit indicator.

Fears of a confrontation between Iran and the United States have mounted since attacks on two oil tankers at the entrance to the Persian Gulf on Thursday. Acting U.S. Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced on Monday the deployment of about 1,000 more troops to the Middle East for what he said were defensive purposes. The Chinese government 's top diplomat warned that the world should not open a '' Pandora 's Box '' in the region.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says more evidence will be released soon to prove the administration 's assertion that Iran was responsible for attacks on two oil tankers last week. But questions have swirled around the evidence and the interpretation of it, in part because allies and some members of Congress question the administration's credibility. The owner of the Japanese tanker has said the crew believes the vessel was hit by a flying object , not a mine , as the United States has asserted.

Kremlin warns against baseless accusations over last week 's attacks on two oil tankers. Washington and Riyadh have blamed the attacks on Iran. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks in the Gulf of Oman. The attacks took place within 30 nautical miles of Iran 's coastline.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says U.S. has evidence linking Iran to oil tanker attacks. Pompeo: The world will come to see much of it, but the American people should rest assured we have high confidence with respect to who conducted these attacks. Iran has denied responsibility for the suspicious explosions in the Gulf of Oman.

The Japanese government has been requesting the United Statesto back its assertion that Iran is to blame for the attacks on two tankers near the Strait of Hormuz on Thursday. The request came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a statement hours after the attacks blaming Iran but without offering proof. The Department of Defense later released a video allegedly showing an Iranian patrol boat removing an unexploded mine attached to the side of the Japanese-operated tanker Kokuka Courageous.

The head of the Arab League is calling on the Iranians to be careful and reverse course. The U.S. says the Iranians are responsible for the attacks near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. The Iranians say they were not involved in the attacks. The British government says it agrees with a U.N. conclusion that Iran attacked two oil tankers.

Tensions between Iran and the United States continued to build over the weekend. President Trump and his lieutenants accused the regime in Tehran of launching attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman last week. But for all the Trump administration 's certainty and ire, the international response to the developments has been rather muted.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that the US considers a full range of options to respond to the attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Pompeo, at the same time, suggested that Washington seeks to prevent the ongoing tension with Iran from escalating any further. Tehran has denied any accusation that Iran was behind the attacks.

The Royal Navy is sending 30 Marines to the Gulf for a training exercise amid Iranian attacks on two oil tankers. Elite soldiers from 42 Commando will leave their Plymouth barracks to form Special Purpose Task Group 19. They will deploy on Royal Navy ships from Britain 's new Bahraini base. Earlier reports that the Marines are being deployed to protect British ships in light of the tensions were denied by the Ministry of Defence.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. will take every action necessary to guarantee safe navigation through the vital shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf. Pompeo, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and well-known war hawk, also defended the administration 's conclusion that Iran was behind the attack. The Strait of Hormuz is a major transit route for oil from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers.



House Democrats passed a nearly $1 trillion appropriations bill on Wednesday. 11 lines in the 667-page bill could literally be the difference between war and peace. They include a repeal of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Three different presidents have used the AUMF for more than three dozen different military engagements in 14 different countries.

The House voted Wednesday to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) The AUMF was passed in the days after 9/11 and gave President George W. Bush the authority to go to war with al-Qaeda and any related organization. For the past 18 years, presidents of both parties have used this same 2001 congressional war authorization as justification for wars all over the Middle East.

House Democrats voted to repeal 2001 's Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF) The repeal is in direct response to allegations by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that Iran has ties to al-Qaeda. Bipartisan legislators are nervous that the Trump administration is closing in on war with Iran.

Xi Jinping is the first Chinese president to visit North Korea in 14 years. Xi and Kim are locked in separate disputes with the United States. The U.S. is demanding that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons development before international sanctions are lifted. Experts say Xi will likely endorse North Korea 's calls for an incremental disarmament process.

US President Donald Trump and China 's Xi Jinping said they plan to meet next week at the Group of 20 summit in Japan. The comments set a more upbeat tone for the talks after worsening tensions created fears over whether the two economic powers would be able to resolve their differences. The United States and China seemed close to an agreement when talks collapsed last month.

The trip comes as Xi is locked in a costly trade war with President Donald Trump. Xi 's meeting with Kim could be seen as a way for the Chinese leader to send Trump a subtle, yet still barbed message. Beijing may also be trying to demonstrate that , depending on what Washington does on trade , it can use its influence to disrupt U.S.-North Korea diplomacy.

The U.S. wanted Iraq to become a typical democratic nation and stronghold in the Middle East. However, the slow motions of the United States gave rise to a brazen Tehran regime robustly embedded in Syria. The Popular Mobilization Force is patently pushed around by the Quds force, which is a special unit in Iran 's Revolutionary Guards.

Iran 's willingness to use long-range missiles in international airspace with little or no warning.

The Strait of Hormuz is the world 's most important oil chokepoint because of the large volumes of oil that flow through the strait. In 2018, its daily oil flow averaged 21 million barrels per day ( b/d ) , or the equivalent of about 21 % of global petroleum liquids consumption. Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have pipelines that can ship crude oil outside the Persian Gulf and have the additional pipeline capacity to circumvent the Strait.

U.S. will impose major additional sanctions on Iran, President Donald Trump says. He says economic pressure will be maintained unless leadership in Tehran changes course. It comes after Iran announced it would exceed internationally agreed limits on its nuclear programme. The reinstatement of US sanctions last year triggered an economic meltdown in Iran.

US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose fresh sanctions on Iran and said military action was still on the table.

Frictions between the United States and Iran have been at fever pitch since Thursday when Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC) downed a US drone.

Iran has rebuffed the overtures of the U.S. administration that has gloated over the country 's recession.

Boko Haram militants have been waging a decade-long insurgency in northwest Nigeria. The conflict has spilled into the Lake Chad region where Nigeria borders Niger, Chad and Cameroon.

He said this in his speech at the Army Headquarters Transformational Leadership Workshop for midlevel officers/soldiers in Abuja. In response, some soldiers fighting in the North East gave Daily Trust on Sunday detailed accounts of casualties they suffered during confrontations with terrorists in recent times.

Venezuelans seeking refuge in Chile can request a democratic responsibility visa. The visa can be requested as of Monday. It will allow Venezuelans fleeing their crisis-hit country to stay in Chile for one year. Chile is part of the 12-nation Lima Group of Western states pushing for Maduro's resignation.

A United Nations report finds that Venezuelans represent the largest group worldwide filing new asylum claims. Those fleeing the troubled South American nation made more than one in five of all asylum requests in 2018. But Venezuela is not in the midst of war and many foreign governments are reluctant to recognize the migrants as refugees.

More than 9,000 Venezuelans entered the country with just their national ID cards on Friday, the highest number ever recorded by Peruvian immigration authorities. Peru 's Foreign Minister Néstor Popolizio said the mandatory humanitarian visa for migrants was a beneficial measure. He said that some exceptions would still be allowed for minors who only have birth certificates and are in transit to Peru to meet up with their parents.

Yemen 's Houthi rebels vow more painful strikes against Saudi Arabia. Houthis claimed responsibility for multiple bomb-laden drone attacks on the two Saudi regional airports. The attacks were the latest in a series of missile and drone strikes launched by the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis.

A British court has ruled that the U.K. government acted unlawfully in selling weapons to Saudi Arabia for use in the Yemen war. The Court of Appeal ruled in favor of anti-weapons campaigners. They argued that the sales should not have been allowed because there was a clear risk the weapons might be used in violation of humanitarian law. The British government plans to appeal the ruling.

Court of Appeal ruled in favor of anti-weapons campaigners. Campaigners argued that the sales should not have been allowed. British government plans to appeal the ruling. Trade Secretary Liam Fox said no new licenses for arms sales to Saudi Arabia would be granted. The Gulf kingdom faces wide international criticism for indiscriminate airstrikes.

The British government on Thursday said it would suspend issuing new Saudi licenses for the sale of arms that might be used in the Gulf kingdom 's bombing campaign in Yemen. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox announced the decision in parliament after a British court ordered the government to reconsider sales due to their humanitarian impact. Campaigners welcomed a Court of Appeal decision to overturn a 2017 High Court judgment which allowed the UK government to continue licensing the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.

In recent weeks, Houthi attacks against military and civilian targets within Saudi territory have markedly escalated. Surge coincided with amplifying pressure from the United States and its allies on Iran, a key regional supporter of Yemen 's Houthis. Surge may be aimed at showing the US and allies that any conflict between them and Iran risks igniting a regional war. Others see the attacks as asymmetric retaliation against US regional allies by Tehran.

UK has suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia over concerns that they might be used in the West-backed kingdom 's bloody aggression on Yemen. UK 's Court of Appeal in London ruled on Thursday that the government had to assess whether the Saudi regime violated international human rights law in its military campaign in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and a number of its regional allies launched a devastating campaign against Yemen in March 2015.

Insurgents from the Ansar Allah movement , known as the Houthis, have shot down a Saudi-led coalition 's reconnaissance aircraft in the skies over Yemen not far from the border with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has not yet commented on the incident. The Yemeni conflict is the world 's worst humanitarian crisis, with an estimated 24 million people - over 80 percent of the country 's population - currently in need of aid.

A British court has ruled that the U.K. government acted unlawfully in selling weapons to Saudi Arabia for use in the Yemen war. The Court of Appeal ruled in favor of anti-weapons campaigners. They argued that the sales should not have been allowed because there was a clear risk the weapons might be used in violation of humanitarian law. The British government plans to appeal the ruling.

The Yemeni Army and Ansarullah Popular Forces captured a military base in Jizan province Southwest of Saudi Arabia. The forces of the Saudi-Emirati coalition who intended to cross the border into Yemen through the Saudi province of Najran were ambushed and repelled. Saudi Arabia has been striking Yemen since March 2015 to restore power to fugitive president Mansour Hadi , a close ally of Riyadh.

Saudi prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against a Saudi religious reformist thinker on a host of vague charges relating to his peaceful religious ideas, Human Rights Watch said today. Saudi authorities arrested Hassan Farhan al-Maliki in September 2017 and have detained him since, finally bringing charges in October 2018. Prosecuting al- Maliki for peacefully expressing religious ideas appears to contradict Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman 's statement in October 2017that he wanted to revert the country to a moderate Islam open to the world.



Yemen 's Houthi movement launched an attack on Abha civilian airport in southern Saudi Arabia. One person was killed and 21 others wounded, the Saudi-led coalition battling the group in Yemen said. Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV earlier said that the Iran-aligned movement had targeted Abha and Jizan airports with drones attacks.

The remains of the projectile the Houthis used in the recent attack on Abha International Airport were inspected by U.S. envoy on Iran. The characteristics of the fuselage and the fins appear to be similar to that of the Soviet Kh-55 cruise missile. The same type of cruise missiles was likely used on the June 19 attack on the al-Shuqaiq Water Desalination and Power Plant in southwestern Saudi Arabia.

Yemen 's Houthi movement said they had targeted Abha and Jizan airports in southern Saudi Arabia with drone attacks. At least 8 people were injured in the drone attack on Saudi Arabia 's Abha airport, Reuters reported Sunday. In the past two weeks, the Houthi group have reportedly attacked Abha  several times. The armed conflict in Yemen between government forces and the Houthis has been ongoing since 2011.

Canadian David Saint-Jacques, Russian Oleg Kononenko and American Anne McClain have landed in Kazakhstan in a Soyuz capsule. The spacecraft undocked from the space station without incident from the orbiting laboratory at 7:25 p.m . ET Monday. The landing appeared to go off perfectly , with the capsule and its parachute appearing in the sky over central Kazakhstan exactly on time.

SpaceX will begin flights to the International Space Station next year. The company will charge about $ 52 million for a seat on a SpaceX flight to the station. The first flight will take off from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The cost of a seat to fly with SpaceX will start at about $52 million.

NASA says the International Space Station is open for business - but not in economy class. The move will allow NASA to focus on returning astronauts to the moon and going to Mars. NASA says it will continue to send astronauts to space in a variety of ways, including cargo and cargo resupply.

Canadian Space Agency astronaut David Saint-Jacques will participate in his last press conference in orbit before returning to Earth on June 24. Michael Groves of the Royal Canadian Mint will recognize the winners of the Wanted : Creative Writers contest. Media representatives unable to attend the press conference will be able to watch it live ( or recorded ) on the CSA 's YouTube channel.

David Saint-Jacques will return to Earth Monday after six months in space. He will set a new record for Canadian space endurance, spending 205 consecutive days in orbit. Another Canadian astronaut, Bob Thirsk, remembers a wild ride that felt like swinging on a pendulum out of control.

Russian space scientists have admitted struggling to find volunteers to supply samples of their semen while living on the International Space Station. Researchers need the samples to help understand how periods in space affect our ability to reproduce.

Mars rover Curiosity has recorded its largest measurement yet of methane. It has never before seen so high a concentration - of 21 parts per billion ( ppb ) The observations are fascinating because on Earth methane is produced in large part by living things. That 's not necessarily the case on Mars ; geological processes are very capable of making it.

'Given this surprising result , we 've reorganized the weekend to run a follow-up experiment , ' said a mission scientist. NASA 's Curiosity Rover found possible signs of life on the red planet this week. However , it 's far too early to conclude that life exists , or ever did exist, on Mars.

NASA's Curiosity rover detected an unusually high amount of methane on Mars. Methane is a gas that is usually produced by living things. Scientists are planning a follow-up experiment over the weekend. NASA has called the observation an early science result and stressed that further testing would be necessary.

Asteroid and comet monitoring is the No. 1 desired objective for the U.S. space program. About two-thirds of Americans call that very or extremely important. About a combined 9 in 10 say it 's at least moderately important. Searching for life on other planets came in fifth with 34 % rating it at least very important.

Mars is belching a large amount of a gas that could be a sign of microbes living on the planet today. NASA 's Curiosity rover discovered startlingly high amounts of methane in the Martian air.

A radio signal coming from a galaxy billions of light-years away has been discovered by scientists. What is producing the signal-a fast radio burst , or FRB-is unknown. For the vast majority of FRBs, scientists do not know where they come from or what is causing them.

CSIRO researchers discovered the pulse of energy using a radio telescope in Western Australia and two other telescopes on two continents. The combination of hi-tech equipment enabled the scientists to determine the unidentified bursts had come from a Milky Way-sized galaxy 3.6 billion light years away from Earth. The question now - especially for those who believe in the possibility of alien life - is how the waves are being produced.

Astronomers have pinpointed the location of a massive burst of energy four billion light years away. The event , known as a fast radio burst '' ( FRB ) , lasted just a fraction of a second. Using the CSIRO 's new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder radio telescope in Western Australia, researchers were able to record it.

Astronomers developed a mosaic of the distant universe called the Hubble Legacy Field that documents 16 years of observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. The image contains 200,000 galaxies that stretch back through 13.3 billion years of time to just 500 million years after the Big Bang. Recently, scientists have detected a dust ring at Mercury 's orbit.

Astronomers have finally pinpointed the galactic origin of a one-off fast radio burst. This is the first time a non-repeating FRB has been localized to a specific galaxy. The burst came from within the outer regions of a galaxy some 3.6 billion light-years away.

For the first time, the origin of a single radio pulse has been pinpointed to a distant galaxy several billion light years away. The cause of the bursts remains unknown but the ability to determine their exact location is a big leap towards solving this mystery. The discovery was made with a new radio telescope in Western Australia and later confirmed using other telescopes in Chile and Hawaii.

Astronomers have discovered the source of a non-repeating fast radio burst and traced its origin to a galaxy 4 billion light-years away. The monumental findings detail the discovery and localization of FRB 180924. The burst was picked up by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, which consists of 36 radio telescopes.

NASA will send a dual-quadcopter drone to hop across the surface of Titan. Named Dragonfly, the mission will launch in 2026 and arrive at Titan in 2034. The nuclear-powered Dragonfly can fly tens of kilometres in less than an hour. Dragonfly beat out a proposed mission to return a sample from Comet 67P.

NASA will fly a billion-dollar quadcopter to Titan , Saturn 's methane-rich moon. The craft will soar and hover over the icy moon 's surface-and land on it. It will search for the conditions and chemistry that could foster life. The mission-led by Elizabeth Zibi '' Turtle-will launch in 2026.

Titan has long intrigued planetary scientists. On Christmas Day 2004, NASA 's Cassini spacecraft sent a probe to the moon 's surface. Dragonfly will carry an assortment of scientific instruments. Drills in the landing skids will collect samples of the Titan surface.

Dragonfly will search for signs of life on the moon Titan. The moon's atmosphere is the thickest in the solar system. Scientists suspect Titan might even have water-real , actual H2O-lurking beneath its surface. Dragonfly could cover tens of miles in an hour.

New research has revealed the existence of crystals made of acetylene ( C2H2 ) and butane ( C4H10 ) that likely form on the shores of Titan 's lakes. The researchers used a cryostat to mimic the extremely cold conditions on Titan , where temperatures plunge to -179.2 Celsius ( 94 Kelvin , ? 290.5 °F ) The first thing to form were benzene ( C6H6 ) crystals. In a surprising development , the Titan benzene molecule arranged itself in such a way that ethane molecules were allowed inside , creating what 's called a co-crystal.

NASA will announce its next major mission to explore the solar system on Thursday. It will choose between two finalists: Caesar and Dragonfly. Caesar would rendezvous with a comet and collect a pristine sample for study back on Earth. Dragonfly is a quadcopter drone capable of soaring across the skies of Titan.

Dragonfly is scheduled to launch in 2025 and will land on Titan in 2034 after a 840-million mile journey from Earth. The craft will be able to propel itself at about 20 miles per hour and fly to altitudes of a little over 2 miles. It will be powered by the heat produced by the decay of plutonium-238.

NASA plans to send a drone to Saturn 's largest moon. Titan is a haze-covered world that has lakes of methane and an ocean below the surface. Scientists have long considered Titan an attractive place to study whether it would be capable of supporting microbial life. Titan was last explored by the Cassini-Huygens mission.

The 1996 winners will also have a psychological advantage when they sport their second choice lucky yellow jersey that they wore against England.

Prison officials in Sri Lanka Thursday said they were yet to receive the documents related to President Maithripala Sirisena 's signed death warrants to hang four drug convicts. President Sirisena on Wednesday signed the death warrants for the four convicts, ending a four-decade-long moratorium on the capital punishment. The last execution in Sri Lankan was 43 years ago. Sri Lanka in March advertised to recruit two hangmen to carry out executions.

Sri Lanka will stick with the yellow shirts they wore in their victory against England as a World Cup lucky charm. Dimuth Karunaratne 's side revived their flagging campaign by upsetting the hosts at Headingley. Sri Lanka will wear their alternative yellow kit in the team 's remaining three group games.

Turkey supports Libya 's United Nations-recog­nised government in Tripoli which retook Gharyan from Haftar forces on Wednesday. Turkey has supplied drones and trucks to forces allied to Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj. The LNA has received support from France , the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, ac­cording to diplomats.

Tripoli 's forces took Gharyan , south of the capital, from eastern forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar. Officials showed journalists weapons they said had been seized , among them sophisticated US-made Javelin anti-tank missiles. They also presented advanced Chinese-made laser-guided artillery shells and said combat drones had been also been captured.

Tripoli 's forces took Gharyan from eastern forces last week. Officials showed journalists weapons they said had been seized. They included sophisticated U.S.-made Javelin anti-tank missiles. Inscriptions on the missiles said they had originally belonged to the United Arab Emirates.

Haftar 's Libyan National Army accused Turkey of supplying armed drones. The LNA banned flights from Istanbul to an airport in eastern Libya. The capture of Gharyan was the biggest setback to Haftar since his forces swept the south. Western diplomats and Libyan officials have warned the conflict would spiral into a proxy war.

Strongman Khalifa Haftar has threatened to attack Turkish interests in Libya after suffering a serious setback in his push to take the capital Tripoli. Anti-Haftar forces supporting Libya 's internationally recognised government announced they had retaken the strategic town of Gharyan in a surprise attack. In retaliation he ordered his self-styled Libyan National Army to target Turkish ships and companies, ban flights and arrest Turkish nationals in the country.

The threats by forces aligned with East Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar toward Turkey is a declaration of war on Ankara, Libya 's High Council of State said on Saturday. The council also requested the UN to take measures to deterHaftar 's forces, adding that it would continue relations with Turkey within the framework of bilateral agreements.

The Presidential Council has condemned the threats made by the spokesman of Haftar 's forces. Ahmed Al-Mismari called for arresting Turkish citizens residing in Libya. The PC said that such threats promote sedition and hatred. It called the UN Mission in Libya and the international community to clarify their positions.

The self-styled Libyan National Army, led by Hifter, already controls much of the country 's east and south. It launched an offensive against the weak Tripoli-based government in April. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into another bout of violence on the scale of the 2011 conflict.

Single-use plastic shopping bags are banned in New Zealand from today. Companies that break ban will face heavy penalties, including fines of up to NZ $ 100,000 ( $ 67,000) Plastic pollution has become a growing global concern. More than 80 countries have already introduced similar bans, according to UN Environment Programme.

Plastic shopping bag ban comes into force on Monday July 1. Retailers caught flouting the ban will be given the chance to mend their ways before being hit with a fine. Businesses have had six months to prepare for the ban, which did not include plastic bags used for bread, deli or meat products.

Environment Minister Eugenie Sage says ending their use is a step towards healthier oceans and giving nature a hand. Businesses were given six months before the ban to phase-out single-use plastic bags. Sage says the Ministry for the Environment will be conducting random retail precinct audits to assess levels of compliance.

Ohio bill would prohibit local governments from taxing or banning single-use plastic containers. Bexley, Bowling Green and Cuyahoga County have enacted bans on single-used containers. Republicans decry costs to business, but clean-up costs paid by taxpayers for plastic amount to more than $ 40 million annually in Ohio.

Legal loophole makes mockery of plastic bag ban. Retailers will still be allowed to sell heavier grade , more environmentally-harmful plastic shopping bags. Government was warned back in March that its ban does n't cover so-called 'emergency style ' plastic bags made from 55 micron LDPE plastic. Officials warned Ms Sage that most people would not hold on to these bags for re-use.



Five vessels set sail to hunt whales commercially for the first time in more than three decades after Tokyo 's controversial decision to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission.

Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission on Sunday after more than 60 years of membership. Japan plans to resume commercial whaling amid criticism from anti-whaling states and conservation groups. It remains unclear whether there will be any increase in demand for whale meat even if commercial hunting begins for the first time in 31 years.

Japan will resume commercial whaling Monday following its withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission. The government has vigorously defended whaling, citing its cultural and historical importance. Commercial whaling will be resumed only within the country 's exclusive economic zone - or 200 nautical miles from its shores.

Japan announced last year it was leaving the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) and would resume commercial whaling on July 1. Japan has long maintained that eating whale is an important part of its culture. The hunt will be confined to Japan 's exclusive economic zone. Only about 300 people around Japan are directly connected to whaling.

Iran has breached the 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium allowed under the 2015 international nuclear accord. The amount is well below that needed to produce one nuclear weapon. The breach shows that Iran intends to ratchet up its response to the United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA)

Iran has been threatening to surpass the limit of 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium that the country is allowed to possess under the nuclear agreement. Breaching the limit would be a symbolic move but would not put Iran significantly closer to building a nuclear weapon. The move would come against the backdrop of knife-edge tensions in the region.

The news was announced by the Fars news agency which is closely linked to the Iranian government. President Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal in May last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran.

Sky Views: Iran is playing a dangerous game with Europe over its nuclear deal. Iran is using the imminent busting of limits on the amount of enriched uranium it can stockpile and the level to which its uranium can be enriched as a tool of leverage. Iran wants to exert pressure on the European parties to the pact to offset the economic pain being inflicted on the country by US sanctions.

Iran has been threatening to surpass the limit of 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. Breaching the limit would be a symbolic move but would not put Iran significantly closer to building a nuclear weapon. The move would come against the backdrop of knife-edge tensions in the region.

Iran 's enriched uranium stockpile has passed the 300 kilogram limit under its nuclear deal. Iranian officials have said in recent days that the Islamic Republic is on track to pass the enriched uranium limit. The limit was set under the nuclear deal after remaining signatories to the pact fell short of Tehran 's demands.

An air strike on a detention centre for illegal migrants in a suburb of the Libyan capital killed 40 and wounded 80, a health official said. Pictures published by Libyan officials showed African migrants being treated in a hospital after the strike. The strike took place in the suburb of Tripoli.

An airstrike that hit a migrant detention center near the Libyan capital early Wednesday has left at least 40 people dead and another 200 injured. Satellite images taken of the detention center in Tajoura showed extensive damage to several buildings in the complex. Libya 's Government of National Accord ( GNA) condemned the attack, blaming renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar.

Libya 's U.N.-backed government reclaimed a strategic town near Tripoli from opposition forces that have been fighting for the past three months. The capture of Gharyan is significant because it had served as a key supply route for the forces of commander Khalifa Hifter. The LNA launched an offensive on Tripoli in April , setting off fierce fighting that has threatened to plunge the country into another bout of violence.

Eritrean migrants detained in western Libya say they were caught in the crossfire. They are among thousands of detained migrants who have suffered abuses at the hands of traffickers.

The Orion capsule aced a critical launch-abort test this morning ( July 2 ) showing that it can indeed get astronauts out of harm 's way during a liftoff emergency. The test version of Orion launched at 7 a.m. EDT ( 1100 GMT ) from Florida 's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The capsule slammed hard into the Atlantic at roughly 300 mph ( 500 km/h ) 7 miles ( 11 km ) off the Florida coast.

The Ascent Abort-2 test ( AA-2) is designed to validate Orion 's emergency abort system under high-stress aerodynamic conditions. The Orion crew module will undergo a full-stress test of its launch abort system. It will be an uncrewed test designed to replicate a real launch , but it wo n't be launched on top of the Space Launch System ( SLS)

The test of the Orion spacecraft 's launch abort system Tuesday at Cape Canaveral is the most important of the program. It will determine if the capsule 's four-person crew can escape if the rocket explodes in the seconds after liftoff. To test the system, NASA built a mock-up of the crew capsule - one that will never be used again.

NASA will test the launch abort system for the Orion spacecraft. The capsule will be launched atop a test booster at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The spacecraft will blast off to an altitude of about 6 miles while traveling at a speed of over 1,000 mph. The data retrieved from this test will help teams improve computer models.

NASA will test out the Orion 's spacecraft launch abort system on July 2 , 2019 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 46. NASA is planning on sending American men and women to the south pole of the moon by 2024 under the program name Artemis. The agency plans to use the Orion capsule , designed by Lockheed Martin, to carry astronauts to Mars and other deep-space missions.

NASA will test the emergency abort system of the Orion spacecraft. Orion is scheduled to take humans back to the moon as soon as 2024. A rocket booster will launch the test capsule to about 31,000 feet. The abort engines will fire , pulling the capsule away from the still-firing rocket.

NASA will test the emergency escape system for Orion on Tuesday. The Orion spacecraft is designed to carry humans to the Moon and beyond. The test is part of NASA's aim to bring manned spacecraft launches back to U.S. soil. There is a four-hour launch window for the test, beginning at 4 a.m. PT.

NASA to conduct critical flight test of spacecraft designed to take astronauts back to the moon. Orion abort system will send mock crew module 31,000 feet into sky, then purposely abort. The spacecraft will plunge into the ocean at 300 mph, and NASA says it will sink and not be recovered.

Tomorrow morning, NASA will test its new deep-space crew capsule to see if the vehicle can keep people safe during a botched launch. The agency will activate a special emergency system on the capsule designed to carry the vehicle away from a malfunctioning rocket to safety. If all goes well, it 'll show that the capsule is ready for flight and pave the way for its first mission to space within the next couple of years.

Orion Ascent Abort-2 is designed to demonstrate the spacecraft can get away from a rocket in flight. The Orion spacecraft would command an abort automatically if sensors detected a malfunction in the launch vehicle. No astronauts will be on-board for Tuesday 's flight , but veteran space flier Randy Bresnik said he is eager to see the results.

House Democrats sue for six years of President Trump 's tax returns. The lawsuit is the latest step in a months-long battle with the Trump administration. Democrats want the court to enforce a subpoena requesting the returns. Republicans have sided with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, calling the request baseless.

Donald Trump is the first president in 40 years not to disclose his personal income tax returns. Democrats could have asked for copies of the president 's tax returns on their first day in control of the House of Representatives on Jan. 3. Instead, they waited until April 3.

Rep. Richard E. Neal ( D-Mass.) filed the lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has denied multiple requests from House Democrats to turn over Trump 's financial records. Neal first demanded six years of Trump's personal and business returns , from 2013 to 2018, in April.

The European Parliament filled its top EU post on Wednesday, with lawmakers electing Italy 's David-Maria Sassoli as the new president of the assembly. Sassoli secured an absolute majority with 345 votes in the second round of voting. The vote comes on the heels of a difficult agreement reached by the EU 's 28 national leaders on filling the bloc 's top jobs.

European socialists say they are 'deeply disappointed' by nominees for top EU posts. On Monday they came close to a deal that would have seen a socialist Dutchman as Commission chief. But it was scotched by eastern countries, referring to Poland, Hungary and Italy.

David Sassoli is supported by his socialist grouping and by the center-right group. The election of the parliament 's speaker will take place on Wednesday. The appointments for EU top jobs will be made after EU-wide elections in May. The European Parliament is the parliament of the European Union.

Four politicians are running for the position of the European Parliament 's president in the upcoming Wednesday election. The list of the candidates includes Ska Keller, Sira Rego, David-Maria Sassoli and Jan Zahradil. The outgoing President Antonio Tajani will preside over the proceedings.

MEPs previously announced they would elect the head of the assembly on 3 July. European Council has n't been able to agree upon who should fill the bloc's top spots. The new European Parliament has convened to elect a new president to replace incumbent Antonio Tajani after a pan-European vote in May.

The European Parliament is set to hold a second round of voting for the president later on Wednesday. None of the four candidates secured majority in the first round. The parliament will choose from the same four candidates in the second ballot. David-Maria Sassoli, an Italian politician from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats got 325 votes. Jan Zahradil, a Czech politician with the European Conservatives and Reformists got 162 votes. Ska Keller, a German politician of the Greens, secured 133 votes.

David-Maria Sassoli, an Italian member of the Socialists & Democrats bloc, has been elected as the next president of the European parliament. In the second round Sassoli received 345 votes , well over the absolute majority required from the 667 eligible votes. Appointing a new parliamentary president completes the bloc 's drawn-out appointment process for its top jobs.

Sassoli, 63, was elected after two rounds of votes by lawmakers at the first plenary session of the assembly which emerged from EU elections in May. Sassoli , a former journalist from Florence, has been a lawmaker in the EU parliament for a decade. He was elected as speaker for the next 2-1/2 years.

But that virtuous cycle can be fragile , especially in its early stages when gains are uncertain and leaders wary of taking blame.

President Donald Trump on Saturday issued a Twitter invitation to North Korea 's Kim Jong Un to join him for a hand shake during a visit to the demilitarized zone with South Korea. The invitation , while long rumored in diplomatic circles , still struck as an impulsive display of showmanship by a president bent on obtaining a legacy-defining nuclear accord. North Korea responded to offer by calling it a `` very interesting suggestion . '' Presidential visits to the DMZ are traditionally treated as carefully guarded secrets for security reason.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he remained concerned for an Australian student who is uncontactable in North Korea. Morrison said the plight of Alek Sigley had been raised with him by world leaders attending the Group of 20 summit in Osaka. Morrison declined to say which government leaders he had discussed the disappearance with and what help had been offered. He said he did not discuss the 29-year-old student with the leader with the most influence over North Korea , Chinese President Xi Jinping.



Oil tanker suspected of carrying Iranian crude oil to Baniyas Refinery in Syria. Refinery is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria. Britain's ambassador in Tehran has been summoned over the incident. Gibraltar 's chief minister Fabian Picardo praised marines who detained the ship.

Israel will be destroyed in half an hour if the United States attacks Iran, a senior Iranian parliamentarian says. Weeks of tensions culminated last month in US President Donald Trump 's last-minute decision to call off planned strikes on Iran after Tehran downed an American drone. Washington also accused Iran of being behind attacks on ships in the Gulf, which Tehran denies.

Iran announced on Monday it had amassed more low-enriched uranium than permitted under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran 's announcement marked its first major step beyond the terms of the pact since the United States pulled out of it more than a year ago. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the move was not a violation of the accord, arguing that Iran was exercising its right to respond to the US walkout. The move is a test of European diplomacy after French, British and German officials had promised a strong diplomatic response if Iran breached the deal.

European countries want to convince Iran to stick to its nuclear deal with world powers. To keep the deal going without the U.S., Europe has told Iran it will find a way to keep doing business outside normal financial channels. European countries have dubbed their trade mechanism INSTEX, for Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.

The foreign ministers of the UK, Germany and France issued a joint statement Tuesday urging Iran to reverse its decision to breach a limit under a 2015 nuclear agreement. The statement by the European 3 ( E3 ) and the European External Action Service ( EEAS) expressed dismay and concern over Iran 's decision to exceed the limit. The E3 and the EEAS urged Iran to refrain from further exceeding the limits on its low-enriched uranium reserves and thus undermining the nuclear deal.

Ali-Reza Marandi is the head of the Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences. He wrote a letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini. Marandi said US sanctions are preventing medical aid from reaching patients in Iran. He also criticized the EU for not providing Iran with an effective way to bypass sanctions.

Iran has broken the limit set on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, international inspectors and Tehran say. The announcement by Iran 's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and later confirmation by the U.N. nuclear watchdog puts new pressure on European nations trying to save the deal. Iran separately threatened to raise its uranium enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels on July 7.

European signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPoA) on Tuesday urged Iran to reverse its decision to exceed the limit on enriched uranium reserves set under the nuclear deal. A joint statement by the top diplomats from the European Union, France, Germany and the UK read , "We regret this decision by Iran" The country stopped complying with some elements of the agreement in May a year after the US unilaterally withdrew from the deal.

U.S.-Iran tensions are once again heating up. Iran has officially breached the limits of low-enriched uranium as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. As a result, the Trump administration 's stated desire of its maximum pressure campaign - to constrain Iran 's nuclear ambitions - is having the opposite result.

Iran says it believes India will act in its national interest on the issue of oil imports. Iran 's Ambassador to India Ali Chegeni also asserted that his country can provide affordability, accessability and security of energy to India. He alluded to the possibility of using barter , rupee and European mechanisms for trade in oil with India and other countries to circumvent US sanctions.

Financier Jeffrey Epstein , a registered sex offender, was arrested on Saturday for alleged sex trafficking of minor girls in Florida and New York, multiple sources tell ABC News. Epstein was taken into custody Saturday at Teterboro Airport in Bergen County, New Jersey, in an undercover operation. Authorities also raided Epstein 's New York City home Saturday night and into early Sunday. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting and procuring a person under age 18 for prostitution, but served just 13 months of an 18-month sentence.

A New York federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered the unsealing of up to 2,000 pages of judicial documents. The documents are expected to show evidence relating to whether New York financier Jeffrey Epstein and his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, were recruiting underage girls and young women. The decision comes two days after the Miami Herald urged the court to issue a ruling in the civil case in the wake of last week 's Justice Department announcement that it would not void Epstein 's controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement.

Federal prosecutors say a once-secret plea deal reached over a decade ago with Epstein must stand. Prosecutors say a violation of the Crime Victims ' Rights Act does not allow for the agreement to be voided. Some of the victims claim the deal should be thrown out at least partially because they were not consulted as required under that law.

Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire money manager whose friends include President Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. Epstein recruited roughly three dozen underage girls - generally from poor and troubled families - to his house in Palm Beach and sexually abused them. Epstein could have faced federal sex trafficking charges and faced life in prison. Instead, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida - Alex Acosta - gave Epstein immunity.

2,000 pages of court documents centre around activities of American financier Epstein. Epstein was jailed on child prostitution charges in 2008. His former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell - daughter of disgraced newspaper baron Robert Maxwell - has been fighting to keep the 167 files under wraps. Documents are from a 2015 defamation case against the heiress brought by alleged trafficking victim Virginia Roberts - photographed aged 17 in Ms Maxwell 's London apartment. Ms Roberts claims she was forced to have sex with Epstein from the age of 16.

Jeffrey Epstein will appear in court in New York on Monday. The charges allege that Epstein sexually exploited dozens of underage girls in a now-familiar scheme : paying them cash for 'massages ' and then molesting or sexually abusing them in his Upper East Side mansion or his palatial residence in Palm Beach. Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from underaged girls, although the non-prosecution agreement led to an 18-month prison sentence that allowed him to work from his office in Florida.

Taliban fighters killed at least eight security personnel and six civilians in a car bomb attack in central Afghanistan. The suicide attack in Ghazni province on Sunday came as an all-Afghan peace conference began in Qatar in an effort to end years of violence. At least 60 children attending classes in a private school near the blast site were among the 180 people wounded. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.

Analysts and Afghan officials are skeptical that a comprehensive deal could be reached. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that he hopes for a peace deal before Sept. 1.

Iran has announced it will begin enriching uranium beyond the limit set in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The move on Sunday was part of an Iranian effort to press Europe to salvage the accord after the United States pulled out last year. Under the pact, Iran agreed to enrich uranium to no more than 3.67 percent , which is enough for power generation but far below weapons-grade levels of 90 percent.

President Hassan Rouhani 's threat could narrow the estimated one-year window it would need to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon. But as tensions rise a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal, it looks unlikely Europe can offer Iran a way to sell its oil on the global market.

President Hassan Rouhani further increases pressure on European partners to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal. U.S. withdrew from the accord last year and restored crippling economic sanctions.

Ali Akbar Velayati says in a video posted on a website for Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran appears poised on Sunday to increase its uranium enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels. Iran has yet to say how far they 'll enrich their uranium , thoughVelayati mentioned a need for 5 % -enrichment in his filmed comments.

The United Arab Emirates has reduced its forces in Yemen as part of a strategic redeployment. The UAE is a major coalition partner in the Saudi-led military campaign to quash Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The draw-down would affect two main areas: the coastal Yemeni city of Hodeidah and Assab.

There was a time - and to the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler , Mohammed bin Salman , it must now seem a long time ago - that a war against Yemen 's Houthi rebels sounded like a very good idea. More than four years on the folly of that ill-thought out impulse is there for all to see. It is the Saudis who have been the target of global condemnation for the way in which they have conducted the war while the Emiratis have by and large escaped opprobrium.

The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia lacked legal standing to object to his alleged violations. Trump quickly celebrated the decision and even seemed to adopt the court 's suggestion that serving as president was hurting the Trump businesses.

Justice lawyers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overrule a federal judge and instead allow for a mid-case appeal or to dismiss the case outright. The government lawyers also want the court to suspend legal discovery recently approved by Judge Emmet Sullivan. The lawsuit was brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York. It argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.

Iranian boats unsuccessfully tried to seize a British oil tanker in the Persian Gulf Wednesday, US officials say. The Iranian boats ordered the tanker to change course and stop in nearby Iranian territorial waters. The British Navy frigate HMS Montrose had been escorting the tanker from the rear. It trained its deck guns on the Iranians and gave them a verbal warning to back away.

UK warned by Tehran over the return of oil tanker. The Middle Eastern country 's judiciary chief Hojatoleslam Seyed Ebrahim Raeisi sent the warning after its unlawful move to capture the vessel. The tanker was taken over amid suspicions it was carrying oil to Syria and breaking EU sanctions.

Crew members from a Norwegian-owned oil tanker apparently attacked in the Gulf of Oman landed Saturday in Dubai after two days in Iran. The other tanker targeted in the assault limped into anchorage off the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates. Both the mariners ' recollection and the physical evidence remaining will play an important role in determining who the international community blames for Thursday 's explosions on board the oil tankers.

Vincent Lauerman is president of Geopolitics Central, a Calgary-based energy consultancy. He says the possibility of Iran attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz to tanker traffic has increased significantly in recent weeks. Lauerman says the impact on global oil supplies would be relatively minimal, but we would still seeCrude prices fall back to pre-crisis levels.

U.S. military releases video it says shows Iran 's Revolutionary Guard removing limpet mine. Iran denies being involved in the attack, accusing the U.S of waging an "Iranophobic campaign" Iran previously used limpet mines against oil tankers in 1987 and 1988 in the Tanker War.

President Donald Trump blames Iran for attacks on oil tankers near Strait of Hormuz. But he also holds out hope that implicit U.S. threats to use force will yield talks with the Islamic Republic. The Pentagon considers beefing up defenses in the Persian Gulf area. Iran denied any involvement in the attacks and accused Washington of waging economic warfare.

Two oil tankers near the strategic Strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked on Thursday. Details of the suspected attack on the ships in the Gulf of Oman of the coast of Iran were still vague. Incident comes amid growing friction between Washington and Tehran in an area already fraught with tension. Norwegian Maritime Authority had earlier issued a warning to the country 's merchant fleet.

The U.S. military released a video Friday it said showed Iran 's Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded limpet mine from one of the oil tankers targeted near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Limpet mines, which are magnetic and attach to a ship 's hull , are designed to disable a vessel without sinking it. Iran denied any role in Thursday 's apparent attacks, which have again roiled the Persian Gulf amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington.

Trump Labor Secretary Acosta resigning after criticism over Epstein plea deal in sex case. The wealthy financier was arrested over the weekend and charged in the Southern District of New York with sex trafficking dozens of girls. He is accused of having sex with dozens of young girls.

The daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California was caught spreading fake news Wednesday in the form of a fabricated quote from Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta. Acosta has been under fire for his handling of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein 's case while he was a federal prosecutor in Florida. The fake quote appeared to have come from a tweet by The Atlantic 's David Frum, who acknowledged that the comment should not have been phrased in a way that looked like a quotation.

Alex Acosta held a press conference to defend his actions in the Jeffrey Epstein case that he prosecuted in 2008. Julian Zelizer: Acosta looked collected and in control to his supporters, but to those who were unsympathetic to him. He says Acosta did himself a disservice with those who want him to resign as Labor Secretary, in part because his department is in charge of protecting children.

Jeffrey Epstein 's $ 77 million New York mansion housed several strange items that hinted at his sexual deviancy, a new rape accuser alleges. In court documents filed on Wednesday, Jennifer Araoz claims she noticed a pair of prosthetic breasts and a bizarre self-portrait of Epstein when she was first brought to the businessman 's Upper East Side townhouse back in 2001. Araoz, who says she was 14 at the time she was lured to the address, claims she was groomed for weeks by a female 'recruiter' Epstein entered a not guilty plea on Monday in court for his alleged sexual abuse of three minors.

Jeffrey Epstein is accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them at his homes in Florida and New York from 2002 through 2005. Epstein was arrested over the weekend as he arrived in the U.S. from Paris aboard his private jet. Prosecutors said they would seek to keep him in jail while he awaits trial, contending he might flee if released on bail.

Judge Andrew Napolitano says Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. 's role in a 2008 sex-trafficking case involving financier Jeffrey Epstein is 'more than curious and merits investigation' Vance 's office argued that Epstein was a dangerous sex offender likely to prey on young women again, much to the shock of Justice Ruth Pickholz who ruled against this assertion at the time. Epstein was required to register as a sex offender in Miami in 2008 as part of a nonprosecution plea deal agreed to by Acosta.

Fox News ' Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld criticized the media and Democrats for focusing on Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and not disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was charged this week with sex trafficking and conspiracy during the early 2000s based on new evidence and pleaded not guilty on Monday in New York City federal court.

Democratic strategist Christine Pelosi now advises fellow liberals in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein 's child sex trafficking indictment. Pelosi's daughter has chronically downplayed, whitewashed or excused the sleazy habits and alleged sexual improprieties of a long parade of Dem pervs. Michelle Malkin: Epstein, Bean & Buck : The Democratic Donors ' Sex-Creep Club.

Jeffrey Epstein, 66, is accused of creating and maintaining a network that allowed him to sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls from 2002 to 2005. Eleven years ago, Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta - now President Donald Trump 's labor secretary - approved an extraordinary secret agreement in which Epstein pleaded guilty to lesser state charges. On Monday, a New York prosecutor announced the indictment of Epstein on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.

Europe's satellite-navigation system, Galileo, remains offline. The network suffered an outage on Friday due to what has been described as a technical incident. Engineers worked around the clock over the weekend but there is no update yet on when the service will resume. Galileo is still in a roll-out , or pilot phase , meaning it would not yet be expected to lead critical applications.

The European Union 's Global Navigation Satellite System ( GNSS ) Galileo experienced an unexpected signal outage over the weekend. The Galileo system was launched in 2016. Its space segment consists of a constellation of satellites that transmit radio signals for position, navigation and timing purposes. The signals are not to be used, the European GNSS Service Centre said.

The European global navigation satellite system GNSS Galileo was not functioning for more than 60 hours. The failure may be associated with malfunction of systems at the centre of the exact time located in Italy. Galileo cost about 10 billion was created by the European space Agency to ensure the independence of the European Union in matters of satellite navigation.

 Galileo is the world 's fourth geo-location satellite system. The EU has poured some €10 billion into the system. Galileo is set to be fully operational by the mid-2020s with 30 satellites in orbit. Only a limited number of consumer mobile phones are equipped to pick up Galileo 's signal.

The European Union 's satellite navigation system, Galileo, has been down for four days due to a technical incident on the ground. As of Monday morning, 24 of the 26 satellites in Galileo 's constellation are still not usable. Only Galileo Search and Rescue ( SAR ) service - used for locating and helping people in distress situations - is unaffected.

Galileo network went offline on Friday, meaning all receivers will not be picking up any timing or positional information. Worryingly, this includes most smartphones, which must now rely on data from GPS or Russian and Chinese networks. Problem lies with a fault at a Precise Timing Facility ( PTF) in Italy, according to specialist publication 'Inside GNSS '

Europe 's Galileo satellite network -- used by satnavs , financial institutions and more -- is in the throes of a huge outage. The system has been down since Friday meaning that travelers ( and others ) in Europe have instead had to fall back on the American Global Positioning System ( GPS ) -- or even Russia or Chinese systems. Galileo is currently only in the testing phase , and has only recently been approved for US smartphones by the FCC.

The European Union 's Galileo global navigation satellite system has n't worked since last Thursday. A service status page lists 24 of its 26 satellites as "not usable '' or "not available" The remaining 2 are " testing," which our sister site ZDNet noted means they are n't usable.

The EU 's new satellite navigation system - which the UK is set to be controversially excluded from due to Brexit - has suffered a major outage. The system suffered a technical incident related to its ground infrastructure which has affected all of its users. The issue specifically affects the European spacecraft ground station in Fucino in Italy where atomic clocks are used to synchronise the signals.

 Galileo has 22 orbital satellites helping to pinpoint and track mobile telephone users and vehicles. It is due to become fully operational around the globe next year offering a civilian alternative to US and Russian-controlled networks. Although controlled by a civilian agency , planners hope it will also underpin the strategic independence of future European military systems.

Ursula von der Leyen narrowly elected president of the EU Commission. Centre-right defence minister will replace Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November. She secured backing of more than half of the members of the European parliament. The Commission drafts EU laws, enforces EU rules and has power to impose fines.

Ursula von der Leyen will have no shortage of pressing tasks on her agenda. Among the most urgent should be reforming the dysfunctional process that got her there. Deciding who fills this essential role is a maddening game of thrones. The key is to strengthen ties between national parties and the larger political families.

Ursula von der Leyen is chasing support among left-leaning factions to put her over the top. At least half of the 153 Socialist members will probably support her. The 60-year-old polyglot is the centerpiece of a European top-jobs package.

Ursula von der Leyen will have no shortage of pressing tasks on her agenda. Among the most urgent should be reforming the dysfunctional process that got her there. The commission presidency sets the EU 's policy agenda, allocates key portfolios and directs a civil service of 30,000. Deciding who fills this essential role is a maddening game of thrones.

Luke Ming Flanagan says Ursula von der Leyen spoke of the need to tackle climate change. But he says she defended the Mercosur deal, which he has described as a potential environmental catastrophe. He says she completely sidestepped his questions on the issue.

Ursula von der Leyen has no illusions about Tuesday 's vote in the European Parliament. Her nomination is part of a deal between EU leaders that is dependent on their being able to whip their MEPs into line. She needs the votes of 376 out of 750 MEPs - that is possible with EPP, some Socialists and Democrats and RE votes.

Ursula von der Leyen faces vote on her European Commission presidency by MEPs tomorrow. She must secure at least 374 votes before she can be crowned as the first woman head of the European Commission. Green and socialist MEPs have publicly signalled that they will not offer their support when the vote is held tomorrow evening.

Christine Lagarde says she will step down as managing director of the IMF. It comes ahead of a decision on her nomination to become head of the ECB. The former French cabinet minister has been head of IMF since 2011. If the European Council approves her ECB nomination, she will become the central bank's first ever female leader.

French court decides not to place Christine Lagarde under investigation over a payout made when she was finance minister. Some 400m euros ( £342m ; $ 516m ) was paid to disgraced tycoon Bernard Tapie in 2007. Ms Lagarde insisted she had always acted in the interests of the state.

The IMF will soon start the process of choosing a new managing director. Christine Lagarde is set to leave the organization in a few months ' time. EU ministers have made it clear they want to see someone from their continent take the job. Since the IMF 's formation back in 1945 , the managing director has always been from Europe.

Christine Lagarde has been anointed to succeed Mario Draghi at the helm of the ECB. The question now is whether Lagarde's skills are in tune with the task of leading the ECB in the post-Draghi era. Lagarde 's greatest challenge is that she is replacing a man credited with saving the eurozone by means of policies that are no longer fit for purpose.

Christine Lagarde will take over from Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank this autumn. Among those welcoming her will be some lesser-known members of Draghi's inner circle. Their expertise will prove crucial in helping her to settle in, writes BL. 'Draghi relied heavily on those around him - and Christine Lagarde can do the same '

Telford & Wrekin Council 's managing director Richard Partington is to leave his job. Mr Partington was appointed to the post in 2011 and his departure is a mutually agreed decision says the Council. The Council says it will start the process to advertise for and appoint to a new chief officer role.

Ms. Lagarde trained as a lawyer before becoming a minister in the French government. Supporters point out that the I.M.F. played a crucial role in preventing the collapse of Greece's banking system during the eurozone debt crisis. She can be expected to address a gender imbalance at the central bank ; just two of the 25 members of its governing council are women.

Investors are betting that Christine Lagarde will act in much the same way as the bank 's last leader. Interest rates fell to record lows in the days after she was named. Ms. Lagarde is the respected managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She will take over at a time of economic uncertainty.

IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde will submit her resignation from the global financial lender on Tuesday. Her resignation comes after Lagarde was nominated on July 2 to be the next head of the European Central Bank. She did not immediately resign from the IMF because of uncertainty over whether the new European Parliament would approve her.

Christine Lagarde says her resignation is effective Sept. 12. She said she had more clarity about her nomination to be the next head of the ECB. Lagarde 's nomination is subject to approval by a fractious European Parliament. If approved, she would take over as ECB president from Mario Draghi on Oct. 31.

ESA and the European Southern Observatory have concluded that asteroid 2006 QV89 is not on a collision course this year-and the chance of any future impact is extremely remote. The object was discovered in August 2006 and then observed for only ten days . These observations suggested it had a 1-in-7000 chance of impacting Earth on 9 September 2019. After the tenth day , the asteroid was unobservable and has not been seen since. Now , after more than a decade , we can predict its position with only very poor accuracy.

Asteroid 2006 QV89 just performed the cosmic equivalent of shouting '' Boo ! '' It might have startled us , but it wo n't cause any real damage. The European Space Agency said the asteroid had an extremely tiny 1-in-7,000 chance of impacting Earth in September.

Japan 's Hayabusa 2 spacecraft is now the first spacecraft to retrieve a subsurface sample from an asteroid. On July 11th , the spacecraft touched down for a second time on asteroid 162173 Ryugu. This time, the probe retrieved a sample from a crater it excavated with its impactor. The samples will go to JAXA's Extraterrestrial Curation Center and scientists can request portions of the sample.

The 20-50 meter asteroid 2006 QV8 will NOT hit the Earth on September 9th. Follow-up observations have once again confirmed that none of the asteroids we know about are at risk of impacting the Earth. This could be the first time that an asteroid strike has been ruled out in a method like this.

Astronomers at the University of Hawaii have demonstrated that their ATLAS and Pan-STARRS survey telescopes can provide sufficient warning to move people away from the impact site of an incoming asteroid. They detected a small asteroid prior to its entering the Earth 's atmosphere near Puerto Rico on the morning of June 22 , 2019. The asteroid was only 500,000 km from Earth - or 1.3 times the distance to the Moon.

On July 4 and 5, astronomers used the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile to observe those spots. And crucially , there was no sign of the asteroid . The team says that even if the rock was smaller than expected , it still would have been visible had it been there.

Asteroid 2006 QV89 is not on a collision course for Earth this year. The chance of future impact is "extremely remote," according to the European Space Agency. The small object-about 65 to 165 feet in diameter-made headlines recently based on a very small chance of contact this September.

Asteroid 2006 QV89 was first spotted in 2006 and was observed for 10 days. It then simply vanished and can no longer be tracked by telescopes. The space rock had a 1-in-7,000 chance of hitting our fragile planet on September 9. Asteroid is quite small so would not destroy humanity if it smashed into Earth.

Sudan 's ruling military council and an alliance of opposition groups sign first of two documents. The two sides inked the Political Declaration in Khartoum in front of African Union and Ethiopian mediators. Sudan has been in a state of flux since former President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in April.

Sudan's main protest group is opposed to granting military rulers absolute immunity against possible prosecution for violence against protesters. Differences over the issue of immunity have been a major sticking point holding up the signing of a power-sharing deal. Opposition groups accuse the Rapid Support Forces of responsibility for the death of more than 125 protesters during a raid on a protest sit-in on June 3.

Sudan army, protesters meet to discuss transition deal. The deal includes a joint Sovereign Council that will rule for a little over three years. It was meant to end a weekslong political deadlock between the military and protesters since a Khartoum protest sit-in was broken up by security forces last month.

The gossip in Westminster is that those unnecessary 'coward ' jibes that Hunt made when Boris refused to appear in the first television debate have not been forgotten.

Boeing is still working on fixing flight-control software that appeared to play a role in crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia.

Boeing is the largest U.S. manufacturing exporter and one of the nation 's top private employers. The MAX is its best-selling plane, and jets worth more than $ 30 billion sit idle since March. Boeing hopes to resume deliveries in the fourth quarter, but some airlines and officials expect the MAX to stay out of service until next year.

Fitch revises Boeing 's ratings outlook from stable to negative. The negative revision of the outlook is based on regulatory uncertainty regarding the timing and global sequencing of the 737 MAX ' return-to-service.

Fitch and Moody 's downgrade outlooks for Boeing, citing uncertainty and delays in 737 MAX jets' return to service. The revision follows Boeing 's nearly $ 5 billion in quarterly losses related to the grounding of the jets over two recent deadly crashes. Fitch estimates that consolidated debt for the company will rise by almost $ 10 billion to nearly $ 24 billion in 2019.

Six I-League sides wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and FIFA president Gianni Infantino last week seeking their help in the clubs 'fight for survival. In the last decade, more clubs have either shut shop or scaled down their operations than those who have entered or stayed in the top division.

Nasa will look for signs of life from a relative nearby planet after it was spotted by a brand new space telescope. The world - the first nearby super-earth spotted by the brand new Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( Tess ) spacecraft - is one of three newly found exoplanets. The planet is known as GJ 357 d , and orbits a star around 31 light years away. It is close enough to that star to be in the habitable zone - where it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface.

NASA 's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has discovered three new worlds that are among the smallest , nearest exoplanets known to date. The planets orbit a star just 73 light-years away and include a small , rocky super-Earth and two sub-Neptunes - planets about half the size of our own icy giant. Astronomers believe TOI-270 's sub- Neptunes may be a missing link in planetary formation as they are of an intermediate size.

Three new planets have been discovered using NASA 's newest planet-hunting satellite. One is rocky and slightly larger than Earth while the two others are gaseous and roughly twice the size of our planet. The new star system is called TESS Object of Interest , or TOI-270. Follow-up observations on the system have been planned for 2021.

Scientists with the University of Chicago were able to calculate its mass more precisely than any other planet this small to date. The Kepler mission was designed to look specifically for exoplanets-planets orbiting stars in distant systems. Both planets zip around the sun in a matter of days : 3.99 days for the larger , 2.66 for the smaller.

A theoretical physicist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest developed a new method for analyzing exoplanet systems. Tamás Kovács ' method could allow scientists to determine whether a system of exoplanets might move or orbit chaotically or regularly. Determining whether or not an exoplanetary system is chaotic could tell scientists more about it.

NASA launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TESS) in 2018. TESS will scan the 360-degree bowl of the sky and limit its survey to comparatively local stars. The TESS spotted a trio of planets orbiting a dwarf star known as TOI 270. Two of the planets are a sort of cosmic equivalent of an evolutionary missing link.

The planet - which has been named LTT 1445Ab - orbits close to the primary star at just one-tenth of the distance between the Sun and Mercury. Each of the three stars is a so-called M dwarf - active , but smaller in size than our sun - that circle around each other in a complex orbits.

Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned in Southern Nevada on Saturday, following his appearance at a presidential candidate forum sponsored by the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees. Biden said he supports increasing legal immigration offering a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and others who are currently in the country illegally. He said none of his plans would require a tax increase on the middle class.

Joe Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for US president in 2020. His lead in the polls has proven durable, but some fear a replay of 2016. A key segment of his support is older voters, notably including African Americans. But some fear this plays into Trump's hands, fueling his argument that Democrats are radical socialists.

If Tuesday 's Democratic debate was overwhelmingly ideological, Wednesday 's debate was intensely personal. The attacks flew across the stage, with Harris and Biden facing especially heavy fire. Booker tried to look crisp, knowing that looking old was a far greater enemy than anyone on the stage. Biden gave as good as he got this time around.

Democratic 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden has made his political partnership with ex-president Barack Obama a centerpiece of his White House campaign. But several 2020 candidates scorched the popular ex- president at their Democratic debate. The strategy risks alienating voters as the party seeks to regain the White House. Obama loyalists concerned about repelling the very voters who Democrats need to motivate to the ballot box.

U.S. President Donald Trump 's vow to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods sparked an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war. S & P ; 500 futures EScv1 late in the day dropped over 1 % after the United States officially designated China a currency manipulator. The yuan weakened past the key seven-per-dollar level to its lowest level in 11 years. Apple shares slid 5.2 % as analysts warned that the newly proposed tariffs may hurt demand for the iPhone.

U.S. Treasury Department declares China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994. U.S.-China trade war boiled over on Monday as Washington accused Beijing of manipulating its currency. China let the yuan drop to its lowest point in more than a decade. The designation starts a formal process of bilateral negotiations.

China threatens retaliation if U.S. President Donald Trump 's planned tariff hikes go ahead. The renewed acrimony between the two biggest global economies sent stock markets tumbling. Tokyo 's main stock market index fell 2.5 % by midday and Hong Kong's benchmark lost 2.3%.

Beijing says it is ready to retaliate if President Donald Trump goes through with his threat to impose punitive tariffs on another US $ 300 billion in Chinese goods on September 1. The 10 per cent duties would extend Washington 's border taxes to almost every import from China. The new batch likely to include hairdryers, sneakers, flat-screen televisions, bridal wear and toys.

Washington state and the Northwest have a tremendous stake in future relations between the U.S. and China. China is Washington state 's top export market, amounting to more than $ 16 billion in 2016. The Trump administration is acting on multiple fronts to decouple the economies of the United States and China, authors say.

China has allowed its currency to weaken in value compared with the dollar. A weaker renminbi gives Chinese companies an advantage when they sell their products in other countries. China has drawn nearly $ 1 trillion from its huge stash of foreign money to hold its currency steady. The currency is under pressure to depreciate for a number of reasons.

China 's offshore yuan weakened beyond 7 per dollar in early Monday trade. The 7-level was seen as a crucial barrier defended by the People 's Bank of China. It is the lowest level since offshore trading began in 1992. ( Reporting by Noah Sin and Winni Zhou Editing by Shri Navaratnam)

The renminbi traded in mainland China on Monday morning at roughly 7.02 to the dollar. A higher number represents a weaker currency. The move by itself will not change China 's trade relations with the United States. But it could represent a new stage in the economic conflict between the two countries.

Beto O'Rourke was one of the first to deliver a statement shortly after news broke that there was an active shooter at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg also took a jab at Donald Trump, stopping just short of placing the onus of the massacre on his shoulders.

A law enforcement official says at least 15 people were killed in the attack at an El Paso shopping center. The suspect who was taken into custody is 21-year-old Patrick Crusius. Police say most of the victims appear to have been at a Walmart near the Cielo Vista Mall.

It was the highest daily casualty toll in the Ukrainian conflict since a truce was agreed nearly three weeks ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the incident an attempt to undermine Ukraine's efforts toward peace.

Kyiv says pro-Russia separatists opened fire at Ukrainian military positions in the Donetsk region on July 6. A new cease-fire agreement was supposed to go into effect on July 22. Since April 2014, more than 13,000 people have been killed in fighting between Ukrainian forces and the separatists.

China and Pakistan have both issued warnings to India over recent moves to assert control over disputed border regions. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for the repeal of Article 370 granting special autonomy to the stretch of Kashmir located on its side of contested borders with China and Pakistan. Indian Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah introduced bills naming both the state of Jammu and Kashmir and its Ladakh region as separate union territories.

Opposition offered its 'full cooperation' to the PTI government to give a befitting response to the Modi government on its decision to revoke the held-Kashmir 's special status. PML-N vice-president Maryam Nawaz opposed her uncle 's offer to shake hands with Imran Khan on this issue. She said no support from the opposition should be offered to a government that was not only non-representative but had brought Pakistan to its knees.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday asserted that Pakistan occupied Kashmir ( PoK ) and Aksai Chin are part of Jammu and Kashmir. Shah said that BJP leaders will give up their lives to secure PoK. PoK is basically a part of the J & K invaded by Pakistan , whose borders touches Pakistan 's area of Punjab, Afghanistan 's Wakhan corridor and China's Xinjiang region.

Beijing China said on Tuesday that India should avoid unilateral actions in Jammu and Kashmir that could spark tensions in the region. In a swift response, India 's external affairs ministry rejected the Chinese criticism and said the proposal for a new union territory of Ladkah was an internal matter. The Chinese foreign ministry issued two statements in Mandarin on the issue on Tuesday.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah made it clear in the Lok Sabha that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir ( PoK ) and Aksai Chin are part of the state. He also dared the Congress to make its stand clear on the Kashmir issue. Shah said the issue was not political and that the legislation was based on constitutional and legal provisions.

Emergency meeting of OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir was held in Jeddah in the wake of illegal actions by India to alter the internationally recognised disputed status of Indian-occupied Kashmir. Meeting was chaired by Assistant Secretary General OIC Ambassador Samir Bakr Diab and attended by Minister of Foreign Affairs Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi.

China has asked India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and avoid actions that unilaterally change the status quo and exacerbate tensions between the two countries. China is seriously concerned about the current situation in Kashmir, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a written response to media queries. Hua said she was not directly referring to revocation of Article 370 by India.

China is the only P5 member country that is party to the Kashmir dispute by virtue of its Faustian deal with Pakistan in 1963. It is well-known that China has a larger-than-life influence over Pakistan. China is in a position to leverage the next moves by Islamabad on the J & K situation in practical or political terms. The Chinese reaction to the announcement in Delhi on Monday relating to J &K has come in two parts.

India and Pakistan are the most likely countries to start a nuclear war. Pakistan voiced some dissatisfaction with some Indian government 's steps to normalize the conditions on the disputed territory. India has been proposing peaceful solutions , but Pakistan has done the same thing a long time ago. Right now, India has sent the army to empty the streets which are empty and resemble ghost towns.

The Chinese government has criticized India 's decision to change the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was opposed to the move because Beijing 's claims to part of the disputed territory were included in the Indian-administered region. China administers Aksai Chin , a northwestern Kashmiri region.

Tardigrades are the toughest animals on Earth. They were spilled across the moon's surface when a spacecraft crashed into the surface. The organisms may well have shrugged off the collision, the organisation behind the mission has said. The animals could potentially survive on the moon for years, a tardigrade expert said.

Tardigrades are microscopic animals that can survive in almost any environment. An Israeli spacecraft called Beresheet crashed on the moon in April. Some people wondered if the water bears could survive. Arch Mission Foundation founder Nova Spivack says he's confident the library survived the crash.

Arch Coal Inc ( NYSE : ARCH ) is expected to pay $ 0.45 on Sep 13, 2019. Arch Coal Inc 's current price of $ 78.29 translates into 0.57 % yield. Omnicell Inc ( NASDAQ : OMCL ) has risen 28.56 % since August 5, 2018 and is uptrending.

Beresheet was the first privately funded lunar lander to attempt to touch down on the moon. It ended with a crash on April 11. Nova Spivack watched a livestream of Beresheet 's mission control from a conference room in Los Angeles. He is the founder of the Arch Mission Foundation, a nonprofit whose goal is to create a backup of planet Earth. The library is a DVD-sized archive containing 30 million pages of information.

The Beresheet lunar lander crashed on the moon in April. It was carrying a micro-archive the size of an optical disc containing DNA samples, millions of pages of data and thousands of dehydrated tardigrades. The archive was the brainchild of American venture capitalist Nova Spivack 's Arch Mission Foundation.

I-ON DIGITAL CORP ( OTCMKTS : IONI ) had an increase of 4466.67 % in short interest. Arch Coal Inc ( NYSE : ARCH ) is expected to pay $ 0.45 on Sep 13 , 2019. The stock decreased 1.41 % or $ 1.1 during the last trading session, reaching $ 77.19. It has outperformed by 10.10 % the S & P500.

Israeli lunar lander Beresheet crash-landed into the Moon in April. SpaceIL spacecraft was apparently carrying thousands of microscopic tardigrades. Research has previously shown that dehydrated micro-animals can be revived decades later. The organization announced in June that reattempting the same mission would not present a sufficiently great challenge.

Tardigrades are regraded as Earth 's hardiest animal and can withstand the most brutal conditions known to man - and now thousands of them are on the moon. They formed part of the 'Lunar Library ' project masterminded by serial entrepreneur Nova Spivack. It hoped to use the Beresheet mission as the first step towards creating a 'Earth back-up ' composed of all of mankind 's knowledge. Alongside the Bible and an Israeli time capsule were David Copperfield 's secrets and a recipe for queso-Mex appetiser - provided by a Texo cafe in Texas.

U.S. national security adviser John Bolton says Washington is ready to impose sanctions on any international company doing business with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Bolton: We are sending a signal to third parties that want to do business with the Maduro regime: proceed with extreme caution. His speech came a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that freezes the assets of the Venezuelan government. The 15-member U.N. Security Council will be unable to take any action.

Michelle Bachelet said the sanctions would hit the most vulnerable sections of society. The unilateral measures freeze all Venezuelan government assets in the US and ban commercial transactions. They are aimed at piling pressure on President Nicolás Maduro to step down. The US is one of more than 50 nations that do not recognise Mr Maduro as Venezuela 's legitimate president.

Daniel Larison: Donald Trump is serious about a possible U.S. blockade of Venezuela. He says a blockade would inflict even more misery and death on tens of millions of innocent people. Larison says the U.N. should reject any attempt at a blockade by the Trump administration.

Nicolas Maduro said Venezuela is prepared for battle if the US imposes quarantine. Maduro was responding to a remark by Donald Trump, the US president, made on August 1 that Trump was considering a blockade of Venezuela due to foreign involvement. Maduro has instructed Samuel Moncada, Venezuela 's permanent representative to the UN, to tell the UN Security Council about the threat.

Venezuela 's President Nicolás Maduro says new financial sanctions will lead to a halt in oil exports to the US. Mr Maduro went on national television to denounce the US sanctions as an illegal act of aggression. The decision will cost the jobs of American citizens and affect investments of US companies, he said.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis directed his state 's law enforcement department Tuesday to handle a criminal probe into Jeffrey Epstein 's jail work release in the late 2000s. Epstein, 66, is currently facing indictment in Manhattan federal court where he is accused of child sex trafficking. He was arrested in early July at a New Jersey airport after flying there from Paris on his private plane. Prosecutors in that case say he sexually abused dozens of underage girls at his Manhattan townhouse and Palm Beach mansion.

Jeffrey Epstein has been linked to many famous people, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Epstein told a mutual acquaintance during Trump 's 2016 presidential run that he had compromising photos of the President. Epstein has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw has suspended the work release program that allowed the disgraced financier to visit his office.

Harvard biologist George Church says he and other scientists should have been more cautious in their dealings with Epstein. Epstein was accused last month of having brought girls and young women to his Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, homes for sex. Church says scientists are as vulnerable to flattery and attention from prominent people as anyone. Church has helped develop genome sequencing and CRISPR genome editing.

Jeffrey Epstein 's source of millions has always been a mystery. Some speculate that he 's been running an extortion racket. Epstein obtained a New York mansion, a private plane and a luxury estate in Ohio - valued at roughly $ 100 million all together - previously owned by Mr. Wexner or his companies.

Jeffrey Epstein is accused of trying to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed who ought to be replicated.

The chopper is outfitted with two four-person divans that face each other rather than individual seats. Epstein is reportedly selling the chopper at a deep discount because he needs liquid assets to post his £82m bail. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and child sex trafficking in the abuse of dozens of underage girls.

Jeffrey Epstein sent a dozen red roses to the school desk of one of his underage victims following a massage at his Florida mansion, police documents state. The billionaire 's former butler also claimed he was ordered to wipe down the pervert 's sex toys following visits from young girls. Epstein has been locked up in the Manhattan jail ahead of a trial for charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls.

Jeffrey Epstein wanted to seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar with his thinking. Epstein 's vision reflected his fascination with what has become known as transhumanism.

Illegal armed groups have forced about 40,000 people to flee their homes as they fight for control of drug trafficking routes in Colombia 's Catatumbo region, says Human Rights Watch. The 64-page report highlights the significant security challenges that Colombia still faces after the government signed a 2016 peace deal with the Farc guerrilla group.

The 2016 peace accord between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC) presented a landmark opportunity to halt the serious abuses and atrocities associated with a decades-long armed conflict. Yet in practice , the government does not exercise effective control over all territory in particular areas reclaimed from the FARC. Armed groups have committed a range of abuses against civilians, including killings, disappearances, sexual violence, child recruitment, and forced displacement.

After 50 years of conflict, the Colombian government signed a historic peace agreement with the country 's once-largest rebel group. President Iván Duque is trying to back out of key provisions, painstakingly negotiated. Colombia 's military leaders have ordered soldiers to prioritize attacks against illegal armed groups. In the countryside, the government is n't investing in infrastructure and ensuring security.

Separatists in southern Yemen have seized all government military camps and the presidential palace in the port city of Aden, according to security sources and witnesses. A spokesman for the Security Belt, a militia aligned with the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council, said fighters from the group met no resistance when they seized the all-but empty presidential palace. The move put the separatists in effective control of Aden and Hadi 's government accused the STC of staging a coup. The violence highlights a rift within the alliance and threatens to open a new front in Yemen 's five-year-war.

Fighting within the anti-Huthi front threatens to make an already multi-faceted conflict even more complex and intractable. Clashes in Aden reveal tensions within the Saudi-led coalition and highlight the pressing need to address Yemen 's southern question now rather than wait until a post-conflict political transition. UN, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates need to avoid the worst and help forge a durable solution.

The Yemeni government said on Friday that it was working with the Saudi-led coalition to set up a special committee to investigate the clashes between presidential guards and the separatist Southern Transitional Council. The altercations began on Wednesday after Hani Ben Brik , the STC vice president, called on supporters to overthrow President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi 's government. Main clashes erupted in the vicinity of the presidential palace of Ma'ashiq in Aden.

The fighting erupted on Wednesday and has continued unabated between pro-government fighters and those seeking an independent south. Doctors Without Borders tweeted Friday that it had treated 75 people in a hospital run by the charity including seven who were in a critical condition.

Violence began this week after the separatists accused an Islamist party allied to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi of complicity in the killing of an earlier missile attack on a military parade in the southern port city. At least eight civilians were killed on Friday in renewed clashes between southern separatists and government forces.

The Russian authorities launched a money laundering case against opposition politician Alexey Navalny and froze bank accounts associated with his Anti-Corruption Foundation. There are many indications that this crackdown has reached cyberspace.

The Russian Foreign Ministry says it has summoned Tim Richardson from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. At issue is an August 2 travel warning that outlines details of the protest, including the time it will take place. Moscow has witnessed protests since authorities banned many opposition and independent candidates from running in a municipal election in September.



El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, aseguró que Kim Jong-un, le ofrecido una " pequeña disculpa '' por las recientes pruebas de misiles balísticos de corto alcance realizadas por su propio gobierno. Y agregó that el líder norcoreano está abierto a reanudar las negociaciones sobre el tema nuclear cuando terminen los ejercicios militares de Estados Unidos and Corea del Sur.

North Korea says U.S. is inciting military tension. Pyongyang would have to 'reconsider the major steps we have taken so far,' a North Korean diplomat in Geneva said. North Korea has threatened to attack the United States and its allies if they try to destabilize the situation.

South Korea and the U.S. in March signed a deal to increase Seoul 's payments. The White House said it would look into the apparent discrepancy between Trump 's tweet and those figures. Trump's financial demands have triggered worries in South Korea that he might withdraw some of the 28,500 troops.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said talks could be held within a "a couple of weeks" Pompeo was speaking shortly after returning from Asia and a failed effort to meet with officials from the isolated country. He also pointed out that North Korea 's recent tests were of short-range missiles.

Wallace was responding to a remark by USA Today columnist Raul Reyes. Reyes had noted that Trump has talked about an infestation through illegal immigration. Wallace was a communications director for former President George W. Bush. She tweeted that her mistake was n't intentional and that she was sorry.

North Korea said Wednesday leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire demonstration of newly developed, short-range ballistic missiles. Kim expressed satisfaction and said the launches would send an appropriate level of warning to the military exercises between the United States and South Korea that began on Monday. South Korea confirmed they started Monday but has n't given details about the drills.

North Korea said Wednesday leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire demonstration of newly developed , short-range ballistic missiles. The missiles were intended to send a warning to the United States and South Korea over their joint military exercises. Its four rounds of weapons demonstrations in two weeks come during a stalemate in nuclear negotiations and after President Donald Trump repeatedly dismissed the significance of the tests.

US president Donald Trump demanded that South Korea pay substantially more to the US for defending them against North Korea. South Korea agreed last year to a significant increase A larger payment may be a hard sell in South Korea. The issue of payments for South Korean defense will likely be discussed when US Defense Secretary Mike Esper visits South Korea this Wednesday.

North Korea continued to ramp up its weapons demonstrations by firing two presumed short-range ballistic missiles into the sea. North Korea 's fourth round of weapons launches in less than two weeks came amid a standstill in nuclear negotiations. President Donald Trump repeatedly dismissed the significance of the country 's recent tests despite the threat the weapons pose to allies South Korea and Japan.

North Korea said Saturday its leader Kim Jong Un supervised another test-firing of a new multiple rocket launcher system. The report by Pyongyang 's official Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea said it detected North Korea firing projectiles into the sea off its eastern coast. Experts say the North 's increased testing activity is aimed at ramping up pressure on Washington and Seoul over stalled nuclear negotiations with the United States.

FBI agents swarm Jeffrey Epstein 's private Caribbean island. "We were just trying to look at pretty fish ... and here we are in the middle of an FBI raid , '' said Kelly Quinn , the owner of Salty Dog Day Sails. "Here we are ... in the midst of anFBI raid," Kelly Quinn said.

According to a new report by 'The Daily Mail ' newspaper, Jeffrey Epstein confided in guards at the jail where he was held that someone had tried to kill him. The Daily Mail source also told the paper that Epstein was not despondent and in fact was finally starting to adjust to prison. Epstein 's cell mate at the time, former police officer Nick Tartaglione who has been charged with a quadruple murder, denied that he harmed Epstein and instead claimed that he saved Epstein's life.

The FBI and the Justice Department 's inspector general 's office will investigate how Jeffrey Epstein died in an apparent suicide Saturday. Epstein was accused of orchestrating a sex-trafficking ring and sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. He was found unresponsive in his cell Saturday morning at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

Financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in New York, officials said Saturday. His death angered some accusers who had hoped to confront him in court and see him serve a long prison sentence. Epstein was accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then sexually abusing them at various locations.

Jeffrey Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at New York 's Metropolitan Correctional Center. Two law enforcement sources told CNN that Epstein died by suicide. Epstein had been jailed since early July, when he pleaded not guilty to charges by New York federal prosecutors. No foul play is suspected in Epstein 's death, a federal official says.

Jeffrey Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at about 6:30am on Saturday morning. He was taken to hospital, but it was already too late . The billionaire financier 's shock death came barely a month after he was arrested on July 6 and charged with sex trafficking and conspiracy. Prosecutors alleged Epstein and his associates had paid dozens of underage girls to engage in sex acts. Epstein was facing up to 45 years in jail . Now he will never be brought to justice .

Epstein 's ability to slip away even when those around him are held to account reaches back to well before he 'd accumulated any fortune. Epstein 's first great escape is a tale of financial wizardry and brazen criminality. Hundreds of thousands of Americans lost their retirement money on an investment intended to enrich only its creators.

Jeffrey Epstein 's death by hanging in his cell in a New York jail appears to be a macabre final escape in a long series of evasions by a fabulously wealthy financier and convicted sex offender. Epstein used his private jet and Palm Beach, Florida, parties to lure presidents and plutocrats into his orbit. Epstein was a Wall Street washout with a knack for numbers and , according to those who worked with him, a mind set on deceit.

Jeffrey Epstein 's cause of death was suicide by hanging, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner says. The medical examiner 's determination came almost a week after the multimillionaire was found in his cell. Epstein was awaiting trial on federal charges accusing him of sexually abusing underage girls and running a sex trafficking ring.

Epstein accuser sues; prison guards 'asleep ' when he died, reports claim. Two employees failed to check on Epstein for three hours and then falsified prison logs to cover up their error, the New York Times reported. The revelations came a day after the warden of the high-security facility was temporarily reassigned and two guards put on administrative leave by the Bureau of Prisons.

Jennifer Araoz said she was recruited by an unnamed woman outside her Manhattan high school in 2001.

Epstein 's optimism behind bars was so great that it struck some of those around him as 'delusional,' a source said.

Gibraltar refused a US request to seize the Iranian tanker Grace 1 on Sunday. A federal court in Washington on Friday issued a warrant for the seizure of the tanker. British Royal Marines had detained the vessel in Gibraltar in July on suspicion that it was carrying oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.

The U.S. is seeking to take control of the oil tanker Grace 1, along with all of the petroleum aboard and $ 995,000. The tanker and its cargo of 2.1 million tons of Iranian light crude oil remain lay at anchor off the British overseas territory. A lawyer for three crew members released from detention says the Indian national who captained the Grace 1 has asked his Iranian employers to replace him.

U.S. issued a warrant to seize the vessel for violating international law. Grace 1 was seized off the shore of Gibraltar by British Royal Marines last month. British alleged that Iran breached sanctions by exporting crude oil to Syria. Iran and the US are at the loggerhead since US President Donald Trump in 2018 decided to withdraw from 2015 Nuclear deal.

The US has reportedly issued a warrant to seize the Iranian oil tanker Grace 1. Comes just a day after a Gibraltar judge allowed the release of the detained vessel. The oil tanker along with the oil it carries and hundreds of thousands of dollars are subject to forfeiture based on a complaint by the US government.

The U.S. is seeking to take control of the oil tanker Grace 1, along with all of the petroleum aboard and $ 995,000. The ship is now in Gibraltar and is in need of repairs that could prevent its immediate departure. The tanker and its cargo of 2.1 million tons of Iranian light crude oil remain at anchor off the British overseas territory.

The US Department of Justice unsealed a seizure warrant for the Iranian-flagged supertanker Grace-1 late Friday. The warrant alleges a scheme to unlawfully access the U.S. financial system to support illicit shipments to Syria from Iran by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Grace 1 - now renamed the Adrian Darya - may not have made it far though it was filmed moving on Friday. It 's expected that Iran will release the detained Stena Impero in a tit-for-tat gesture.

The US Justice Department issued a federal warrant on Friday for the seizure of Grace 1. The move comes just a day after a Gibraltar judge had allowed the release of the detained vessel. The vessel was detained in Gibraltar by the British Royal Marines on July 4 on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria.

The eight radio bursts identified on Earth were spotted by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment ( CHIME ) radio telescope. It is hoped the find will provide scientists with broader data which could finally unlock their extraterrestrial origin. A separate observation from researchers in Australia has yet to be published, but it brings the number of findings in August alone to nine.

Astronomers have spotted eight new and particularly unusual fast radio bursts. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment ( CHIME) has found eight more. One of the new FRBs appears to be the closest we 've ever spotted. Teams have already started tracking down the home galaxies of CHIME 's new repeaters.

The finding could shed new light on the origin and nature of these mysterious phenomena. FRBs are intense bursts of radio emission lasting milliseconds.

So-called fast radio bursts ( FRBs) were first discovered in 2007. These fleeting blasts of radio waves originate thousands of light years from Earth. A team of Canadian and American researchers using CHIME has reported a major new set of FRB detections. The group says it 's discovered eight new FRBs that repeat.

Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment ( CHIME) has found eight more repeaters. Repeaters are bursts that repeat many times from the same spot in space. One of the new repeaters appears to be a lot closer to Earth than previously thought. This could be useful as astronomers try to unravel mystery of what is causing them.

The Syrian Arab Army ( SAA) has entered Khan Sheikhoun after the militants withdrew from the northern sector of the city this morning. The Syrian Army is now combing through the empty neighborhoods to secure the city and clear any explosives left behind by the jihadist rebels. Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham 's spokesperson said earlier today that their forces had withdrawn to the southern part of theCity.

The Syrian Arab Army ( SAA) has reinforced their checkpoints in western Daraa after a series of attacks by the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) and Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham sleeper cells. According to a military source in Damascus , the Syrian Army sent these reinforcements from the capital to the western countryside. The Syrian Army concluded their military operations in DaraA in the Summer of 2018.

A source from the Syrian Arab Army ( SAA) told Al-Masdar News on Tuesday morning that the militants have begun withdrawing from the city of Khan Sheikhoun and several towns in northern Hama. According to the source , the militants are only left with two choices : stay and face a potential siege or withdraw and secure others areas in northern Syria. This latest report comes just a day after the jihadist rebels lost a great deal of territory to the SyrianArab Army at the northern axis of Kahn Sheikhoun.

The northern part of Khan Sheikhoun is ultimately a ghost town after the militants withdrew to the southern part of the city. Despite claims of the Syrian Army entering the city, a source from the military has denied these claims. HTS has denied fully withdrawing from the city ; instead, their spokesperson said they are currently in the southern sector of theCity.

The Syrian Arab Army ( SAA) has entered Khan Sheikhoun after the militants withdrew from the northern sector of the city this morning. The Syrian Army is now combing through the empty neighborhoods to secure the city and clear any explosives left behind by the jihadist rebels. Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham 's spokesperson said earlier today that their forces had withdrawn to the southern part of theCity.

The Syrian Army forces entered the key town of Khan Shaykhun in Idlib province for the first time since they lost control of it in 2014. The town serves as a major bastion for terrorists in northwestern Idlib province. Reports say clashes are underway between the Syrian forces and Nusra Front terrorists. Idlib remains the only large area in the hands of foreign-backed terrorists after the Syrian army managed to wrest back control of almost all of the country's land.

The Syrian Arab Army ( SAA) scored a big advance east of the strategic city of Khan Sheikhoun on Wednesday. Led by the 5th Corps and Republican Guard , the Syrian military began their advance by seizing the key hilltop of Tal Tari. According to a military source at this axis east of Khan Sheikhoun , the SAA is working to besiege the pocket after talks between the Russian and Turkish armed forces collapsed.

The Syrian Arab Army ( SAA ) is still not in control of the strategic city of Khan Sheikhoun, despite media claims of the jihadist withdrawal. According to a military source near the front-lines, the Syrian Army entered the northern part of the city. He added that the jihadist rebels of Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham are believed to maintain a presence at the southern entrance.

The Syrian Arab Army has begun entering Khan Sheikhoun from all axes in a bid to secure the city. This move comes just hours after the military managed to capture Tal Tari and several points near the town of Al-Ta'manah. At this time, the Syrian Army is working to capture Al- Ta'anah to completely encircle the jihadist rebels in the northern countryside.

The Syrian Arab Army ( SAA) has completely cutoff the militants from all supply lines in southern Idlib and northern Hama. Khan Shaykhun was a key stronghold of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham ( HTS ) and its allies. The fate of the Turkish observation post in Northern Hama remains unclear.



The main insurgent group in the Syrian province of Idlib pulled out of a key rebel town on Tuesday amid intense bombardment and airstrikes. As the militants withdrew, government troops moved into northern and western neighborhoods of Khan Sheikhoun. The withdrawal is a significant gain for President Bashar Assad 's forces as they try to chip away at territory controlled by the opposition.

The withdrawal is a significant loss for the opposition in Idlib. Khan Sheikhoun is a stronghold of al-Qaida-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Backed by Russian air power, Syrian President Bashar Assad 's forces were able to enter a small part of the town overnight.

The main terrorist group in the Syrian province of Idlib pulled out of a key rebel town as government forces advanced in the area. The withdrawal is a significant loss for the opposition in its last major stronghold of Idlib in northwestern Syria. Syrian government forces have been on the offensive in Idlib and northern parts of Hama Province since April 30.

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham militants in Idlib will be crushed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. He added that Turkey has been notified about that. The statement comes after Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said earlier in the day that Turkey was in contact with Russia over the Syrian Air Force 's recent attack on a Turkish military convoy.

The main Syrian militant group linked to Al Qaeda pulled out of a key rebel town following the Syrian government forces ' campaign of bombardment and airstrikes. The withdrawal is a major loss for the militants in its last major stronghold of Idlib, in northwestern Syria. The group pledged to continue fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad 's forces - backed by Russia - and defend the territory it still holds.

Khan Sheikhoun is a town located on a key road leading to Idlib , the last militant-controlled province in Syria. Since 2014 the town has been under the control of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ( HTS ) The town made international headlines back in April 2017 when it allegedly witnessed a chemical attack, which the US and its allies quickly blamed on the Syrian government.

Militants ' defense in southern Idlib and northern Hama has collapsed. The town of Khan Shaykhun is about to fall into the hands of government forces. Turkey attempted to prevent this scenario by sending a large military convoy ( 28 pieces of military equipment ) accompanied by Turkish-backed militants. The Syrian Air Force carried out several strikes on the convoy path near Heish killing at least one militant field commander.

Mateen Cleaves was found not guilty on all counts Tuesday, Aug. 20. He was first charged with sexually assaulting a woman nearly four years ago. Cleaves, 41, faced single counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. The jury deliberated for less than three hours before returning their verdict.

Former Michigan State University basketball star Mateen Cleaves was acquitted of all charges in a 2015 sexual assault case. A Genesee County jury of nine women and three men reached the not guilty verdict on Tuesday after a two-week trial. Cleaves said the past four years have been tough on him and his family as the allegations swirled around him.

Members of Congress grilled federal and state officials Wednesday on their roles in the crisis over lead-tainted water that recently engulfed the already-struggling city of Flint, Michigan. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder was not asked to testify and was not present at the hearing. The state Department of Environmental Quality ( MDEQ) has taken the brunt of the blame for not requiring Flint to have corrosion control which could have kept lead from leaching from old service pipes. But the EPA has pointed a finger of blame back at EPA as well, saying the agency kept the state waiting months for a legal opinion about whether such corrosion control was required.

A self-styled militia group is now joining in Flint , Michigan 's recovery effort after a public health disaster involving the city 's water supply. The group calls itself the Genesee County Volunteer Militia and consists of members from states around the Midwest. About 30 militia members decked out in camouflage gear were gathered outside Flint City Hall on Sunday demanding government accountability.

President Barack Obama insisted Wednesday that the federal government will do whatever it can to assist residents of Flint, Michigan. Obama declared a federal emergency in Flint on January 14, shortly after the status was requested by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.

The city of Flint is now under a state of emergency because of lead in its tap water. Flint has seen more than its fair share of struggles in the past few years. It 's known as one of the most dangerous cities in America. The poverty that afflicts Flint is part of the reason its residents have been exposed to such dangerous levels of lead.

Mateen Cleaves acquitted on all charges in his rape case in Genesee County Circuit Court. Cleaves is the Flint native who led Michigan State to the 2000 NCAA championship. A jury began deliberating his case at 1:45 p.m. and reached a verdict in about two and a half hours.

The verdict Tuesday by the jury in Cleaves ' hometown of Flint comes nearly four years after a then-24-year-old woman accused Cleaves of sexually assaulting her in a Flint area motel room. The woman testified that she wanted to leave but that Cleaves continued to force himself upon her. Cleaves led Michigan State to the NCAA basketball championship in 2000 and played for four NBA teams.

Cleaves ' attorneys told jurors that the woman lied about what happened because she felt guilty about cheating on her boyfriend.



Italy 's prime minister resigned on Tuesday after launching a blistering attack on his own interior minister. Giuseppe Conte accused Matteo Salvini of sinking the ruling coalition and endangering the economy for personal and political gain. In a shock move on Aug. 8 Salvini declared that his alliance with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement was dead and called for elections.

Italian President Sergio Mattarella has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. He will kick off consultations with party leaders on Wednesday to seek a solution to the political crisis. Mattarella asked Conte to remain in office to carry out day-to-day government business while the discussions continue.

Several migrants jumped into the sea from a Spanish rescue boat Sunday in a thwarted bid to reach shore in Italy. The government 's hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has refused to let the 107 passengers disembark. Open Arms urgently requested permission to enter Lampedusa 's port so the migrants could finally get off.

Italy 's hard-line interior minister buckled under pressure Saturday and agreed to let 27 unaccompanied minors leave a migrant rescue ship after two weeks at sea. The decision temporarily eased a political standoff that has threatened the viability of the populist government. The minors were transferred Saturday to an Italian border patrol boat for disembarkation and processing on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa. The fate of the other migrants still aboard the Open Arms remained uncertain.

Italy 's populist Five Star Movement ( M5S) held a summit on Sunday to attempt to set a course for the future as their coalition with the far-right League party appeared dead in the water. Although the party was divided on a number of issues , one thing was clear after the meeting : The M 5S does not want to work with League party leader Matteo Salvini ever again. The ruling coalition has been on shaky ground for months , with the League and M5s openly in dispute about everything from the political crisis in Venezuela to infrastructure projects.

The humanitarian ship Open Arms had rescued 147 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea near Libya two weeks ago. It won a legal battle to enter Italy 's territorial waters despite a ban by right-wing Interior Minister Matteo Salvini. Most of the migrants remained aboard the ship as Salvini stuck to his resolve to keep humanitarian vessels from docking in Italy.

US President Donald Trump has cancelled a state visit to Denmark. The president was scheduled to visit on 2 September at the invitation of Denmark 's Queen Margrethe II. Last week Mr Trump suggested the US was interested in buying Greenland. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said Greenland was not for sale to the US.

President Donald Trump says the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark came up in conversations within his administration. The semi-autonomous territory of Denmark has said it 's not for sale. Trump cast the possible purchase as a strategic move by the US but not a top priority.

Greenland is not for sale and the idea of selling it to the U.S. is absurd, Denmark 's prime minister says. The White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow confirmed media reports earlier in the week that Trump had privately discussed the idea. Trump is due to visit Copenhagen early next month when the Arctic will be on the agenda.

Greenland is a huge island in the Atlantic, most of it north of the Arctic Circle. It boasts 836,000 square miles of territory - more than a quarter the size of the continental U.S. It counts a population of just 55,000 . In other words, the great landmass is ripe for development.

The Danish prime minister is lashing out at Donald Trump after the American president confirms that he was interested in buying the island of Greenland. A report earlier this week claimed that Trump has frequently raised the idea of purchasing Greenland and has taken careful considerations about the benefits of owning the country. Trump confirmed on Sunday that buying Greenland was a consideration, though he said it was not a high priority for the United States.

Last Week Tonight '' host John Oliver said he was n't all that surprised that President Donald Trump wanted to buy Greenland. The HBO host said it was dumb but not surprising since Trump sends the wrong signals to countries all the time. Oliver showed an unfortunate video of an Australian man telling the protesters they were selfish for fighting for their rights.

President Donald Trump said Sunday the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark has been discussed within his administration. Trump suggested that the semi-autonomous territory is a financial burden to Denmark. The U.S. military has operated for decades from Thule Air Base in Greenland. Trump is expected to visit Denmark in September as part of a trip to Europe.

 Greenland is an autonomous region within the Kingdom of Denmark. Since 1979, Denmark has been in charge of Greenland 's foreign affairs. Greenland decides its internal affairs, including taxation and economic development. US President Harry Truman earlier attempted to buy Greenland for $ 100 million in gold in 1946. Denmark turned down the offer.

US President Donald Trump confirmed his interest in buying Greenland. But he said it was not a priority for his administration. Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Trump had expressed interest in the self-governing part of Denmark. Greenland is home to only about 57,000 people, most of whom belong to the indigenous Inuit community.

President Trump asked an aide to look into whether the U.S. could purchase Greenland-a country that is literally melting. On Sunday night, comedian John Oliver had a field day with the news. Oliver also took issue with Trump 's idiotic response to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong over an extradition bill.



'Various contacts ' made , says embattled president, amid reports he is negotiating a way to stand down. Maduro confirms top Venezuelan officials have been talking to members of Donald Trump 's White House. Reports his second-in-command had been negotiating his downfall with the United States. Observers of Venezuelan politics greeted those reports with scepticism.

The United States has opened up secret communications with Venezuela 's socialist party boss. Diosdado Cabello met last month in Caracas with someone who is in close contact with the Trump administration. A second meeting is in the works but has not yet taken place, according to the report published late on Sunday. The AP news agency is withholding the intermediary 's name and details of the encounter with Cabello out of concern the person could suffer reprisals.

The United States has made secret contact with Venezuela 's socialist party boss. Diosdado Cabello is considered the most powerful man in Venezuela after Maduro. The goal of the outreach is to ratchet up pressure on the regime. Cabello has been accused by U.S. officials of being behind massive corruption.

Claims that Nicolás Maduro 's number two official is working with the US are an attempt to 'stoke paranoia ' , experts say. Diosdado Cabello is one of the most influential and infamous figures in Venezuelan politics. He uses his weekly talkshow to preach permanent revolution and excoriate the evil empire up north. Reports suggest he has been engaged in secret communications with United States officials.

Diosdado Cabello is considered the most-powerful man in Venezuela after Maduro. Cabello met last month in Caracas with someone who is in close contact with the Trump administration. A second meeting is in the works but has not yet taken place. The goal of the outreach is to ratchet up pressure on the regime by contributing to the knife fight.

Diosdado Cabello is the number two in the Venezuelan regime. He is regarded by many as the true power behind Nicolas Maduro 's throne. Cabello met a US intermediary in Caracas in July and a second meeting is planned. The official said that the US would not facilitate Mr Cabello remaining in power. Instead it is hoped that those close to Hugo Chávez 's appointed successor might be persuaded to betray him.

The US is negotiating secret talks with Venezuela 's socialist party boss to get him to agree to remove dictator Nicolas Maduro from power. Venezuela has been in a state of freefall for months as desperate residents flee the country and even basic necessities are scarce. A senior administration official says the US has held talks through an intermediary with Diosdado Cabello who is considered the most powerful man in the country after Maduro.

The death toll from a suicide bomb attack at a wedding hall in Afghanistan 's capital Kabul has risen to 80. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL or ISIS ) group claimed responsibility for the attack. It was Kabul 's deadliest attack since January 2018 when the Taliban packed an ambulance with explosives and detonated it in a crowded street.

'The suffering will continue ' : Groom mourns 63 killed at Afghan wedding amid U.S. withdrawal talks. The deadliest attack to hit Kabul this year comes as the Trump administration appears to be on the verge of signing a deal to end its involvement in the 18-year conflict.

The U.S. envoy who is negotiating with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan says the peace process needs to be accelerated. Zalmay Khalilzad said in a Twitter post Sunday that success will put the country in a much stronger position to defeat the IS affiliate. The Taliban have refused to talk with the Afghan government, dismissing it as a U.N. puppet.

The local Islamic State affiliate claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in the capital this year. The emergence of the IS affiliate in recent years might be the greatest threat to Afghan civilians. Stunned families buried the dead, some digging with their bare hands. The blast took place in a western Kabul neighborhood home to many in the country 's minority Shiite Hazara community.

The bomber detonated his explosives Saturday night in the middle of a dancing crowd in the wedding hall. The attack was claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani vows to eliminate all safe havens for the IS affiliate. Fresh violence was reported Monday as people tried to celebrate the holiday.

Australia has accepted an invitation from the United States to join a coalition of countries protecting oil tankers and cargo ships from attack by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz. Prime Minister Scott Morrison stressed Australia 's involvement will be modest, meaningful and time limited. "This destabilising behaviour is a threat to Australia's interests in the region," Mr Morrison said.

10 American sailors were held by Iran after two US Navy riverine patrol boats drifted into Iranian waters. Iran had originally told the US that the sailors would be returned promptly, but officials now say they will spend the night in Iran. The incident follows new footage released by the Navy of Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessels firing rockets near warships and commercial traffic. Iran denied firing rockets and condemned US plans for new sanctions over its ballistic missile program.

The US Navy released footage it said showed Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessels firing rockets near warships and commercial traffic in the strategic Strait of Hormuz late last month. The Navy said it released the footage in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. It comes as US ally Saudi Arabia has cut ties to the Islamic Republic following attacks on diplomatic posts there after the execution of a Shiite cleric.

Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron held talks on Monday , 19 August, at Fort Bregancon near Toulon. France is counting on Russia 's help to resolve a diplomatic impasse with Iran, according to former French Ambassador to Tehran François Nicoullaud. Both Russia and France remain committed to the preservation of the Iran nuclear deal.

The news came during the visit by Gen. Kenneth McKenzie to the Bahraini capital Manama. The Bahraini government said in a statement that King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa assured McKenzie of his country 's participation. On July 10, the U.S. announced plans to create an international military coalition to safeguard waters off Iran and Yemen.

The US has been seeking to form a coalition to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Gulf. Iran has seized three tankers in strategic Gulf waters since last month, including a British-flagged vessel. The US and its Gulf allies have also accused Iran of carrying out several mysterious attacks on ships in the region, which Tehran denies.

The possibility of Japanese participation in a U.S.-led maritime coalition to ensure freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz became a hot topic of debate in Tokyo. Japan-Iran relations have been generally positive in the past, driven in large part by Japan 's energy needs. Iran is not an easy country to have an independent foreign policy toward, as last summer 's events demonstrated.

An Iranian supertanker, seized by British Marines on suspicion that it was hauling $ 130 million worth of oil to Syria , lifted its anchor and began moving away from Gibraltar. A maritime tracker gave the ship 's reported destination as the Greek port of Kalamata. Greece has received no request from the Iranian tanker Adrian Darya to dock in Greece.

King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa of Bahrain met with CENTCOM chief Gen. Kenneth McKenzie. Bahrain is the headquarters of the U.S. Fifth Fleet. The United States has worked to persuade allies to join a coalition. The plan envisions coalition partners escorting ships through the region.

The ballooning deficit defies a historic trend : Typically, the budget deficit shrinks when unemployment is low. But it is increasing despite the longest economic expansion on record and the lowest jobless rate in 50 years. It also underscores the degree to which Republicans in Washington have largely abandoned that goal.

The 10-year deficit projection has climbed to $ 9 trillion from just over $ 7 trillion earlier this year. The reason for the bulk of the $ 2 trillion increase is that the recession was deeper than expected. The biggest concern would be that foreign creditors might slow their purchases of U.S. bonds.

The final numbers are in for the 2014-15 year federal budget. It shows an underlying cash deficit of $ 37.9 billion. This is about $ 8 billion more than the $ 29.8 billion forecast by treasurer Joe Hockey. The deficit represents 2.4 % of GDP (gross domestic product )

Britain recorded a budget surplus of £1.3 billion in July. This was significantly lower than the £3.5 billion posted in the same month last year. The Office for National Statistics said that there had been an increase in total central government expenditure , which rose by £4.1 billion.

America 's federal deficit will expand by $ 800 billion more than previously expected over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday. The United States was already expected to hit about $ 1 trillion in annual deficits next year. But that shortfall will expanding by $ 1.9 trillion in new spending due to a budget deal to avoid the spending cliff and an emergency spending package for the U.S.-Mexico border.

The United States was already expected to hit about $ 1 trillion in annual deficits next year. The CBO report is likely to intensify concerns that the United States does not have enough fiscal space to stimulate the new economy.

The Congressional Budget Office is upping its projections for this year 's federal deficit by $ 63 billion. The nonpartisan office projects the deficit will exceed $ 1 trillion beginning next year. The office says its projections on both fronts stem mostly from recently enacted legislation that lifted the nation 's debt limit.

The Royal Danish House 's statement was terse: "It came as a surprise" The Obamas were treated to a library tour, attended multilateral presentations, and had to watch a bunch of ballet in 2009.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called the whole thing an absurd discussion. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of the U.S. ally. The political brouhaha over the world 's largest island comes from its strategic location in the Arctic. Global warming is making Greenland more accessible to potential oil and mineral resources.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he scrapped his trip to Denmark because the prime minister made a "nasty" statement.

She called Trump's idea of buying the semi-autonomous Arctic territory of Greenland from Denmark `` an absurd discussion . Trump was scheduled to visit Denmark on Sept. 2-3 as part of a European tour. The cancellation stunned Danes and blindsided the Danish royal palace.

US President Donald Trump declared Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen 's dismissal of his idea to buy Greenland 'nasty' and an affront to the United States. Trump had mused openly in recent days about a U.S. purchase of Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory rich in natural resources. Trump 's decision elicited condemnation, outrage and mockery alike among Danish opposition leaders and the public.

Chair of World for Brexit Peggy Grande says U.S. President Donald Trump is someone to be taken 'seriously not literally ' She said the people who get 'Trump Derangement Syndrome ' are the ones who take him literally but not seriously. It follows reports that Mr Trump has expressed interest in buying the island of Greenland from Denmark.

Rape-slay convict Antonio Sanchez may not walk free any time soon after all , and is not likely to do so, according to justice department officials. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra and Bureau of Corrections ( BuCor) Director General Nicanor Faeldon said Sanchez was not eligible under a 2013 law that credits good conduct time allowance ( GCTA ) for an early release. The former mayor of Calauan, Laguna province, was each sentenced to serve seven 40-year prison terms for the rape-murder of Eileen Sarmenta and for the murder of Allan Gomez.

A thousand Bilibid convicts are set to be released soon because of a Supreme Court ruling that retroactively applied a law on reduced prison term. Convicted rapist and murderer Antonio Sanchez killed two more people - a father and son - aside from the University of the Philippines ( UPLB ) Los Baños students. Human rights lawyer Edre Olalia suggests excluding certain types of heinous crimes from the reduced jail term law.

The impending release of former Calauan Mayor Antonio Sanchez drew criticisms from the online community. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said that the Supreme Court in June released a decision that called for a retroactive application of Republic Act 10592 which increases the time allowances for good conduct among prisoners. The development was met with condemnation from Filipinos who questioned the judicial system.

The likes of Sanchez is a danger to women and to our society, says women 's group Gabriela. Then Calauan mayor , Sanchez and six other co-accused were found guilty of the 1993 killing of two UP students. If Sanchez is freed this year he would have served merely 25 years of the 360 years sentence meted to him.

'Nag-start na kaming makapag move-on , we want to live normal lives pero ito na naman po , bumalik na nman lahat , ' says Eileen Sarmenta 's mother Clara. The law is anchored on the premise of good behavior exhibited by the inmate. Clara has a demand to the government : show proof that Sanchez really did behave.

Antonio Sanchez , who was convicted for 7 terms of reclusion perpetua for rape and murder , has been caught with P1.5-million worth of shabu in his cell. Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon wants a probe into the reduced sentence of Antonio Sanchez.

The retroactive application of the law on Good Conduct Time Allowance will result in the mass release of around 11,000 Bilibid inmates. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said the BuCor has started processing inmates convicted in 1993 or those who have been in jail for nearly 26 years. One of the potential beneficiaries is former mayor Antonio Sanchez of Calauan , Laguna.

'He used his power and position to kidnap , rape , and murder . His actions terrorized a university and an entire town . For full justice to be served , he must remain incarcerated for the duration of his lifetime , ' the petition says. The Change.org petition had more than 26,000 signatures as of 1 pm Thursday , August 22.

Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon says rapist-murderer Antonio Sanchez may not be qualified for earlier release because of his display of 'some not good behavior ' in jail. A law on good conduct time allowance can slash the sentence of inmates jailed in the 1990s by up to 19 years. A Supreme Court ruling in June made the 2013 law , Republic Act No . 10592 , retroactive.

Lawmakers want a review of the Bureau of Correction 's computation on rape-slay convict Antonio Sanchez 's good conduct time. Sanchez received 7 terms of reclusion perpetua for rape and murder, and another 2 terms of life imprisonment for the murder of the political leader of his opponent. After 25 years behind bars , Sanchez is among the 11,000 inmates who will be up for release.

Taliban and U.S. officials resume peace talks in Doha, Qatar. Key issues remain withdrawal of US and other foreign forces from Afghanistan. Agreement on these two central issues would set stage for separate talks with Afghan officials. Taliban has so far refused to speak to Afghan government, calling it a puppet regime.

Zalmay Khalilzad also will visit with the Afghan government. President Donald Trump says he believes the Taliban insurgents are eager to stop fighting. The new talks in Qatar come after a horrific suicide bombing at a wedding in Kabul. The blast led outraged Afghans to question whether a U.S.-Taliban deal would mean peace for civilians.

Afghan officials say the Islamic State has been corralled into a mountainous area near the Pakistan border. But local leaders in the border provinces of Nangahar and Konar tell a different story.

Hundreds of people have gathered in mosques in Afghanistan 's capital for memorials for scores of people killed in a horrific suicide bombing at a Kabul wedding over the weekend.

After talks in Doha, he will travel to Kabul where he will consult with the leadership of the Afghan government. He will encourage full preparation for intra-Afghan negotiations, the State Department says.

We speak with Lotfullah Najafizada , the news director of TOLO news , a 24-hour news channel based in Kabul.

U.S. envoy negotiating with the Taliban for an end to nearly 18 years of fighting in Afghanistan was departing Tuesday for Qatar to resume talks. Zalmay Khalilzad also will visit with the Afghan government to discuss the peace process and encourage full preparation for intra-Afghan negotiations. In Washington, President Donald Trump told reporters he believes the Taliban insurgents are eager to stop fighting.

Jack Keane: U.S.-Taliban deal to end nearly 18 years of fighting -- America 's longest war -- could happen next week. Some 14,000 U.s. troops remain in Afghanistan, and their withdrawal by the end of 2020 is a central part of the talks. Intra-Afghan talks on the country 's political future are expected to follow an agreement, though the Taliban has refused so far to negotiate with the Afghan government.

Conservative radio host and former Illinois US Rep. Joe Walsh will challenge President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2020. Walsh had said Thursday that he was strongly considering entering the race. On Sunday, Walsh called Trump " nuts," "erratic," "cruel" and "incompetent"

Walsh served a single term in Congress representing a district that encompassed suburban Cook , DuPage and Kane counties. He lost reelection in the 2012 to Tammy Duckworth, who now is one of Illinois ' U.S. senators. Walsh backed the president in 2016 - even making a pre-election comment on Twitter that raised some eyebrows.

Rep. Justin Amash is a Republican turned independent congressman from Michigan. Amash announced in an op-ed July 4 that he was leaving the GOP. He remains in the House of Representatives as an independent. It 's unclear if Amash was referring to the possibility of a successful challenge to Trump.

Tammy Duckworth by 9 points in 2012.

On Thursday, former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh all but said he 'll announce a challenge to Trump. He joins former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, who has been running since April. Still on the sidelines are former Tennessee Senator Bob Corker and Mark Sanford. Yet no matter how credible some of these challengers might seem on paper, it would take a political cataclysm.

Conservative pundit and CNN host, S.E. Cupp, accused President Donald Trump of lighting a blow torch to the U.S. economy. She drew a comparison between Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro - who has refused to take responsibility for the fires destroying the lungs of planet Earth - and Donald Trump. The host explained that she believes Trump's desperation is palpable because he spent this week arguing that the United States should buy Greenland.

South Florida Water Management District drawing down canals to help reduce flooding. Forecasters remain uncertain on the track and strength of the hurricane season 's fourth tropical storm.

Saturday should be partly cloudy with a 60 % chance for showers and scattered storms. If Dorian gets bigger than expected we could see less of a chance for storms because of the outflow or sinking air out ahead of it. Right now as the forecast stands the chance for this drying effect would not be happening so count on a few storms for Saturday as well.



SpaceX 's Mars prototype spacecraft, Starhopper, has flown for the last time in an astonishing flight that it saw it hover 150 meters above the ground. The historic flight took place today , Tuesday , August 27 at 5.02 P.M. local time from SpaceX 's Boca Chica test site in Texas. It is the successor of which SpaceX hopes will one day take humans to Mars . This second flight used the same Raptor engine that was used in the first hop - but this time it moved in the air and landed at a slightly to the side of where it took off.

SpaceX 's stubby rocket Starhopper shot into the air Tuesday afternoon in a test launch that brings Elon Musk 's company closer to his vision of human travel to Mars. The craft - a test vehicle for the Raptor engine that will be included in more sophisticated prototypes - was intended to fly about 500 feet in the air. The flight lasted about a minute.

SpaceX is planning to do testing on Monday in south Texas that might damage the homes in the area. The Brownsville Herald reported on Saturday that Cameron County 's Office of Emergency Management sent a notice to Boca Chica Village residents. SpaceX has been developing the launch site since 2014.

A county sheriff went door-to-door on Saturday night to hand-deliver printed notices to the community of Boca Chica, Texas. The hamlet has in recent years become flanked by a rocket launch and development site. The notice says there is a potential risk to health and safety during SpaceX 's upcoming launch attempt of Starhopper. The vehicle is a test-bed for an ambitious new launch system called Starship.

Boeing 's Starliner crew capsule could take off in October on its first unpiloted test flight to the International Space Station. The three-flight test sequence will verify the Starliner 's design and operations scheme before NASA approves the Boeing-built capsule for regular crew rotation missions. The Starliner spacecraft, flying without astronauts on-board, will dock with the space station after launching from Cape Canaveral.

Boca Chica Village is a tiny settlement occupied by just 26 people. Officers reportedly went from door to door delivering a leaflet. Letter told residents they would blast out their sirens 10 minutes before a test flight on August 26. Locals should then make efforts to evacuate the area.

Residents of a tiny village near the Space X-operated launch site have been asked to leave their homes. The village is situated less than 2 miles from the SpaceX facility in Brownsville. SpaceX is preparing for the second flight test of Starhopper - the prototype of a reusable space vehicle for SpaceX 's Starship project.

At around 5pm ET today, SpaceX intends to test a Starship spacecraft prototype called Starhopper at its South Texas launch site. Local residents in Boca Chica Village are n't too happy , though , as police have suggested they leave their homes during the test. The test will involve the 60-foot-tall ( 18m) prototype flying roughly 650 feet ( 200m) lifted by a single Raptor engine before attempting a landing.

A record number of fires ravaging the Amazon has drawn international outrage because of the rainforest 's importance to the global environment. Forest fires in all of Brazil have hit the highest level since at least 2013 and are up 84 per cent this year to Aug 23. Eight out of nine Amazon states have seen an increase with the largest state of Amazonas seeing a 146 per cent rise. Scientists fear that continued destruction of the Amazon could push it toward a tipping point after which the region would enter a self-ustained cycle of forest dieback as it converts from rainforest into savannah.

Soyuz MS-14 is the first Soyuz capsule to visit the space station without a human crew. The spacecraft was originally scheduled to dock at the station 's top-mounted Poisk module on Saturday, but a problem with the automated rendezvous system forced Soyuz to abort. Sunday 's Soyuz move set the stage for Monday 's second docking attempt, which went off without a hitch.

A space capsule carrying a Russian humanoid robot failed to dock as planned with the International Space Station. Russia 's space agency said that the failure involving the planned docking on Saturday was due to faults with the docking system. A new docking attempt will be made on Tuesday. The robot, named Fedor ( Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research ) , was supposed to spend 10 days learning to help astronauts in space.

Soyuz MS-13 spacecraft and its crew have completed redocking from the International Space Station. The manoeuvre was aimed at freeing up the docking port on the Zvezda module for a repeated attempt on Tuesday. The SoyuzMS-14 failed to dock with the ISS on Saturday due to a malfunction of the Kurs automated rendezvous system.

The Soyuz MS-13 and its crew completed eventual redocking from the Zvezda module of the International Space Station ( ISS ) to the Poisk module. The redocking was completed at 03.59 GMT . The crew included Russian cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency and NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan.

An unmanned spacecraft carrying Russia 's first humanoid robot to be sent into orbit failed to dock automatically at the International Space Station on Saturday. Russian cosmonauts issued a command to abort the automated approach of an uncrewed Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS. The docking had been scheduled for 0530 GMT but a live broadcast of the event on the website of the Russian space agency Roscosmos was interrupted. The life-size robot named Fedor is the first ever sent up by Russia and was to stay on the ISS until September 7 learning to assist astronauts.

A Soyuz MS-13 spacecraft with three astronauts inside has undocked from the International Space Station ( ISS ) 's Poisk module. The maneuver finished the relocation move shortly before midnight on August 25. It freed the port for an unpiloted SoyuzMS-14 that currently is on a safe trajectory above and behind the space station to execute a second docking attempt.

A Russian space capsule carrying a humanoid robot has failed to dock with the International Space Station. A statement from the Russian space agency Roscosmos said the failure on Saturday was because of problems in the docking system. The capsule was launched Thursday as part of tests of a new rocket that is expected to replace the Soyuz-FG next year.

Soyuz commander Alexander Skvortsov and two crewmates moved their Soyuz MS-14 spacecraft to a new docking port at the International Space Station on Aug. 25. The move clears the craft 's former docking port ( at the aft end of the station 's Zvezda module ) for an unpiloted Soyuz that had to abort its own rendezvous attempt on Saturday. If all goes well , that docking will occur Monday night at 11:12 p.m. ET ( 03:12 GMT)
