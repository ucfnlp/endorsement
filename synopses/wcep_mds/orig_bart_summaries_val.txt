At least 30 people have been killed in the collapse of a gold mine in Afghanistan. The collapse occurred in the Kohistan district of Badakhshan province.

The gold rally we just witnessed is one I have been expecting. I believe gold will crack the US $ 1,300 mark in the next week or so. The bad news is that I think the rally will lose a little steam around the US$ 1,320 mark. There could be some technical resistance ( a point where the price of an asset struggles to move through ) , and gold punters should be prepared for the metal to turn around and fall. If the gold price falls below my second point , then we can expect gold to fall all the way back to US $1,250.

It is now more than 17 years the US got militarily engaged in Afghanistan. President Trump 's statement a couple of weeks back that the US would soon withdraw half of her forces from the country was soon contradicted by his spokesman and appeared a bluff.

The granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine ( OCU ) by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is a secular event, Metropolitan Antoniy said. The documents that have been earlier signed caused some problems to the Christians, he said. On October 11 , 2018, the Constantinople Patriarchate 's Synod invalidated its decree of 1686 on the transfer of the Kyiv Metropolinate to Moscow.

The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew reigns in Constantinople. His decision last year to recognise the Ukrainian Orthodox church as a body separate from Moscow was celebrated in his cathedral in Istanbul today. It came in the teeth of Russian opposition , and the political rift between Ukraine and Russia is now paralleled by a rift between Moscow and Constantinople.

Orthodox and Eastern Rite churches celebrate Christmas on January 7 using the Julian calendar. Most of the West observes it on December 25 under the Gregorian calendar. Christmas this year comes at a difficult time within the Orthodox religion. Ukraine in October secured approval from the Ecumenical Patriarch to set up an independent church.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew handed the document to Ukrainian Metropolitan Epifaniy at St George 's Cathedral in Istanbul. Russia bitterly opposes the split, comparing it to the Great Schism of 1054 that divided western and eastern Christianity. Ukraine sees the break as vital to its security and independence, but it is bound to aggravate the wider conflict between the two countries.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople has handed over the tomos - a Patriarch 's decree proclaiming the newly formed Orthodox Church of Ukraine formally independent of the Russian Orthodox Church. The tomos was signed in the presence of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko who traveled to Istanbul specifically for the occasion. Poroshenko began to push for the Ukrainian Church 's independence from the Moscow Patriarchy several months before the 2019 presidential elections.

A Christmas Eve mass was held on Sunday by the Fener Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine was formally got independence at a ceremony in Istanbul after receiving the Tomos of Autocephaly ( autonomy ) on Saturday. Bartholomew had said Sunday mass marks a step for the independence of Orthodox Church and Poroshenko 's attendance at the ceremony gave them power.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew signed the tomos of autocephaly of the newly-created Orthodox Church of Ukraine. President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, Parliament Speaker Andriy Parubiy, former President Viktor Yushchenko and other guests attended the ceremony. Before signing , the priests held a prayer in the Patriarchal Church of St. George.

Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I granted the document to Metropolitan Epifaniy. Metropolit was elected leader of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine last month. The document was presented during a liturgy at the St. George Cathedral here Sunday. Bartholew 's office confirmed in October that he was planning to make the move.

The absence of any reaction from the West to Ukrainian authorities ' unprecedented interference in church 's affairs indicates obvious political motives, Patriarch Kirill said. He stressed that if a similar situation took place in Russia, the country would face a barrage of criticism from Western countries and human rights activists. The statement of the Russian Patriarch comes after Patriarch Bartholomew handed over an independence decree to the head of the new church.

The newly independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church held a service in Kyiv on January 7 marking Orthodox Christmas. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and other top officials attended the ceremony at the St. Sofia Cathedral. The development ends more than 330 years of Russian religious control in Ukraine. The church became independent on January 6 with the handover of an official church document.

South of Gold Mountain tells the little-known story of the thousands of Chinese immigrants who came to America and settled in Southern states. The evening , which gives food for thought and refreshments starts at 7 PM with a serving of dim sum.

The last time Chicago Symphony Orchestra played his hometown - Taipei , Taiwan - the stakes were rather high.

CSO management hit on an ingenious idea: Ask Chen to step up as violin soloist.

Malaysia was jolted by the resignation of the Sultan of Kelantan, Sultan Muhammad V, as the 15th Yang di-Pertuan Agong on Sunday. Neither the palace nor the Prime Minister 's Office has given a reason for the sudden abdication of the 49-year-old monarch. Sultan Nazrin Shah, the current Deputy King, will likely serve as Acting King until a new King is confirmed. The Conference of Rulers will hold a special meeting on Jan 24 to choose the new King and on Jan 31 for the swearing-in ceremony.

Malaysia 's king becomes first to abdicate throne just months after marrying Russian beauty queen 24 years his junior. King Sultan Muhammad , 49 has abdicated after just two years on the throne. No reason was given for cutting short his five-year term in palace statement.

Malaysia 's King Muhammad V abdicated on Sunday, the palace said. No reason was given and palace officials did not respond to requests for comment. Images purporting to show him getting married in Russia appeared on social media in December. Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy and the king assumes a largely ceremonial role.

Malaysia 's unique constitutional monarchy means the sovereign is neither absolute nor hereditary. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong - or Supreme Ruler - is elected for a five-year term by the Conference of Rulers. Kelantan 's Sultan Muhammad V abdication is unprecedented , which means that aside from the passing of previous Agongs , this is the first time the Conference must hold an unscheduled election.

Malaysian King Sultan Muhammad V abdicated on Sunday in an unexpected move. The 49-year-old ruler had resigned as Malaysia 's 15th king with immediate effect. It marked the first abdication in the nation 's history. The monarch is highly regarded among the ethnic Malay Muslim majority.

Malaysia 's nine ruling monarchs concluded a meeting at the Istana Negara on Monday ( Jan 7) The meeting was reportedly held to fix a date for the Conference of Rulers to convene again to elect the new Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Only six of the nine Sultans were present at the meeting. Sultan Nazrin will serve as acting King in the interim.

Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan stepped down as Malaysia's King on Sunday. Sultan Muhammad's 16-month reign was marred by a series of controversies. The Agong's secretive Nov 22 wedding to Russian beauty queen Oksana Voevodina was the straw that broke the camel 's back.

Malaysian King Sultan Muhammad V stepped down from the throne on Sunday. The abdication took place following days of reports in regional media speculating that the king might be stepping down after marrying a Russian woman abroad in late November. The king sent a letter to the secretary of the Conference of Rulers notifying them about his decision to resign.

Malaysia 's constitutional monarchy rocked by the sudden resignation of Sultan Muhammad V. It is the first time a sitting king has abdicated. The Conference of Rulers reportedly met to choose a date to elect a new king. Sultan Nazrin of Perak , the deputy king , will serve as acting head of state.

Sultan Muhammad V stepped down as Malaysia 's king on Sunday after just two years on the throne. Dr Mahathir said the election had to be expedited because he had to have an audience with the king on certain matters. The Conference of Rulers held a special meeting at Istana Negara on Monday morning to discuss the date for selecting the new king.

Dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago because of a massive asteroid that hit the Earth in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. A new study says the asteroid also caused a worldwide tsunami that reached more than 5,000 feet in the air. The research suggests that the tsunami impact started in the Gulf of Mexico and quickly spread.

NASA has already begun its design phase on a spacecraft known as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test ( DART) DART will be used to redirect an asteroids path when the massive space rock inevitably heads towards our planet. Tests in outer space could begin as early as 2020 where it will attempt to move a non-threatening asteroid.

Asteroid 2018 YQ2 is expected to approach our home planet just after midnight. NASA 's asteroid experts at the California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL) predict the asteroid will flyby at 12.07am GMT ( UTC ) on Tuesday, January 8. The asteroid is not expected to hit the Earth anytime soon but tonight 's flyby will be the first of two incredibly close encounters this year. NASA expects the asteroid to visit the Earth again in eight months on the evening of August 26 , 2019.

As humanity has armed itself ever more lethally , it has also transformed itself into the local equivalent of so many asteroids, writes Peter Bergen. The asteroidal nature of American acts in the region should be beyond question, he says. Bergen: If you happened to be an Afghan, Iraqi, Libyan, Syrian, Somali , or Yemeni in the twenty-first century, can there be any question that life would have seemed asteroidal?

The European Space Agency is aiming to become the first to put a space probe in orbit around a binary asteroid system. When Hera launches in 2023 , it will be carrying at least two CubeSats. The two nanosatellites will be released into orbit around the pair of asteroids and eventually land on the two space rocks.

Russian military police have started patrolling the surroundings of the northern Syrian city of Manbij in the Aleppo governorate. The route of military police patrols will change regularly, spokesman Yusup Mamatov said. During their missions Russian servicemen are receiving reports from local residents about weapons caches and unexploded ordnances.

There has been no official agreement between the Syrian government and Syrian Democratic Council ( SDC ) on transferring control of Manbij to the former, a military source told Al-Masdar News this evening. The SDC and Syrian government are currently working out details on the future governance of the city. The Syrian Arab Army has been regarded by sources in Damascus as a deterrent measure to prevent Turkish Armed Forces from expanding into northern Syria.

The military police of the Russian Armed Forces began patrolling the territory in the Manbij area in the Syrian province of Aleppo near the Turkish border. After the United States decided to withdraw troops from Syria, Kurdish People 's Protection Units ( YPG) appealed to Damascus to establish control over the areas they had previously occupied.

Brazil has pulled out of a United Nations pact on dealing with rising migration. Brazil joins the United States and a growing number of countries in rejecting the agreement. With a record 21.3 million refugees globally , the United Nations began work on the non-binding agreement after more than 1 million people arrived in Europe in 2015. The accord has been criticized by mostly right-wing European politicians.

A coalition of anti-Islam , far-right and neo-Nazi sympathizers fueled a surge in social media activity about the pact. The burst of activity prompted politicians in several countries to take notice of the previously uncontroversial pact. In Austria and Italy, the researchers found that a surge of online activity preceded government decisions to change tack.

Jair Bolsonaro said he would be open to the U.S. operating a military base on Brazilian soil. The move would mark a sharp shift in direction for Brazilian foreign policy. The possibility of ceding territory for a base took officers by surprise in the Brazilian military. The Ministry of Defense said on Saturday it has not been informed of such a proposal.

At an intergovernmental conference convened under the auspices of the United Nations in Marrakesh , Morocco, 164 nations adopted a pact on 10 December 2018. The 'Global Compact for Safe , Orderly and Regular Migration ' is the first intergovernmental agreement that covers all dimensions of global migration. The legally non-binding pact aims to promote efforts to strengthen regular migration pathways and protect the human rights of migrants.

The global community 's turn towards populism lurched a little further last week when Jair Bolsanaro was sworn in as president of Brazil. The South American giant dominates the continent 's economy , and is the fifth-largest country in the world. Further , it has long been a steadfast bastion of social democracy.

Brazil 's Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo said the declaration released by the Lima Group-arguing that the power of Venezuela should be transferred from President Nicolás Maduro to the parliament-is an opportunity to restore democracy in the country. The Lima Group, comprised of Brazil and 13 other countries urge Maduro to refrain from taking office on January 10 and instead to transfer his power to the National Assembly.

iShares MSCI Brazil is beating the SPDR S & P 500, Russia, India, China ( duh ) and Mexico. Fitch Solutions forecast Brazil 's GDP growth to hit 2.4 % this year, up from 1.3 % last year. Bolsonaro and his cabinet do not fully see eye-to-eye on pension reform. A lack of progress on that front will erode investor confidence.

Mr Trump imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods to pressure Beijing to change its practices.

Chinese President Xi Jinping laid out a template for the unification of Taiwan with mainland China. Mr Xi 's offer was similar to the offer that preceded the takeover of Hong Kong. Hong Kong was told it could keep its democratic political institutions. Today, the ex-British colony 's press is repressed and power lies with whosoever Beijing chooses.

The People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) last year doubled the training period for new recruits from three to six months to improve combat capabilities. President Xi said the world is facing a period of major changes never seen in a century. He ordered the armed forces to continue strengthening their combat preparedness and to make sure they are always ready for battle.



Eddie Lampert had put forward a $ 4.4 billion bid to save Sears through his hedge fund ESL Investments. Sears Holdings had planned to reject Lampert 's bid, which would have put it on a course to liquidation. Lampert will now be required to pay a $ 120 million deposit by 4:00 p.m. Wednesday.

Sears Holding Corp. SHLDQ , -18.26 % is laying the groundwork to liquidate all of its stores. Chairman Eddie Lampert's rescue bid fell short, Bloomberg News reported over the weekend. Lampert could make a last-ditch bid before a bankruptcy status meeting Tuesday.

'' It 's not going to change a damn thing , but I 'm still doing it , '' Mr. Trump said of the border visit. He plans to head to the Capitol on Wednesday to attend a Senate Republican lunch. He later will host congressional leaders from both parties to resume negotiations.

President Donald Trump is heading to Camp David for staff meetings. He showed no signs of budging on his demand for $ 5.6 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The seemingly intractable budget showdown marks the first clash for Trump and Democrats.

NEW: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she plans to pass individual bills to reopen agencies. NEW: The effort is designed to squeeze Senate Republicans, some of whom are growing increasingly anxious about the extended shutdown. A meeting with senior congressional aides led by Vice-President Mike Pence at the White House complex yielded little progress.

White House officials and congressional aides emerged from talks aimed at ending a partial government shutdown over President Donald Trump 's demands for border wall funding. Democrats agreed there had been little movement, saying the White House did not budge on the demand for $ 5.6 billion and would not consider re-opening the government. The White House said funding was not discussed in-depth , but the administration was clear they needed funding for a wall.

US President Donald Trump said there was a productive meeting of Vice President Mike Pence with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The US government shut down on 22 December after Democrats refused to provide $ 5.6 billion in next year 's budget to build a wall on the southern border. Currently there is nearly 600 miles worth of barrier , primarily consisting of 16-foot high fencing , along the 1,900-mile US-Mexico border.

The partial government shutdown is spotlighting the limitations of President Donald Trump 's erratic negotiating style. So far, Trump is standing firmly with the loyal supporters who want him to fight for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But that stance carries considerable risk. The midterm elections revealed a deeply divided Republican Party.

President Donald Trump returned Sunday evening from a meeting with White House staff at Camp David to discuss how to end the shutdown. Trump said he was considering the prospect of declaring a national emergency or offering a steel barrier to end impasse over border security funding at the core of the ongoing partial government shutdown. Vice President Mike Pence again met with congressional leadership Sunday.

White House officials affirmed that request in a letter to Capitol Hill after a meeting with senior congressional aides. Democrats said the administration failed in both the meeting and the letter to provide a full budget of how it would spend the billions requested on the wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she intends to begin passing individual bills to reopen agencies in the coming days.

Astronomers have revealed details of mysterious signals emanating from a distant galaxy. The precise nature and origin of the blasts of radio waves is unknown. Among the 13 fast radio bursts was a very unusual repeating signal. Such an event has only been reported once before , by a different telescope.

We listen to the radio more than ever - whether using a DAB digital radio , a digital TV , a mobile phone or over the internet. Some 600,000 more people tuned into digital radio stations during the first three months of the year. Overall radio listening figures have also risen , with 91 per cent of the UK population now listening to radio broadcasts.

The nation 's massive 500m wide dish is the largest in the world and could be a scientists ' best hope of finding alien life. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ( FAST ) was turned on in 2016 and is made up of 4,450 panels. Experts have been using FAST to scan the universe to search for life.

ExGen Resources Inc. is a project accelerator that seeks to fund exploration and development of our projects through joint ventures and partnership agreements. This approach significantly reduces the technical and financial risks for ExGen , while maintaining the upside exposure to new discoveries and potential cash flow. ExGen currently has 6 projects in Canada and the US.

Mysterious repeating energy bursts have been detected for only the second time. Fast radio bursts - or FRBs - are radio emissions that appear temporarily and randomly. The latest signals to be detected reached Earth from a galaxy 1.5 billion light years away. The most likely explanation is that they were created by powerful objects in space. Experts have debated whether black holes or super-dense neutron stars are responsible. Others have suggested more outlandish theories - such as alien technology.

Canadian-led team of scientists has found the second repeating fast radio burst ( FRB ) ever recorded. FRBs are short bursts of radio waves coming from far outside our Milky Way galaxy. Discovery of the extragalactic signal is among the first results from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment.

Astronomers look to be getting closer to solving one of the more recent and bizarre mysteries in the universe. For just the second time, scientists have picked up a strange radio signal from the other side of the cosmos that repeats itself. Dozens of FRBs have been detected so far, but until recently only one such signal -- FRB 112102 -- was ever observed to repeat itself.

Scientists say recording of sound heard by U.S. diplomats in Cuba matches crickets. Sound heard by embassy workers who fell ill matches a Caribbean cricket. But the finding does n't solve the mystery of what caused the diplomats to fall ill in the first place. The discovery was made by scientists at the University of Havana.

Scientists analyzed a recording of the sound released by The Associated Press in 2017. They found it matched the chirp of the Indies short-tailed cricket Anurogryllus celerinictus. This particular kind of cricket is typically found in the Caymans, Florida Keys and Jamaica.

A recording obtained by The Associated Press was reportedly analyzed by scientists. They determined it matched the sounds of the Indies short-tailed cricket Anurogryllus celerinictus. The sounds were described by diplomats as piercing sounds, buzzing and grinding metal. There were concerns by U.S. officials that the diplomats were the target of an attack.

The sounds were described by diplomats as piercing sounds, buzzing and grinding metal. There were concerns by U.S. officials that the diplomats were the target of an attack.

The mysterious high-pitched buzzing sound associated with suspected sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba may have actually been caused by crickets, according to a report published Friday in a biology journal. The strange incidents began in late 2016 when American embassy personnel began seeking medical care for hearing loss and ear-ringing. Initial speculation centered on some type of sonic attack, but an FBI report in January 2017 found no evidence.

U.S. officials suspected the health attacks were intentional, perhaps perpetrated by the Cuban or Russian governments. Scientists analyzed a recording of the sound reportedly related to the incidents released by The Associated Press in 2017. They found it matched the chirp of the Indies short-tailed cricket Anurogryllus celerinictus.

Noise reported by US diplomats in Cuba not of weapons but insects, study says. Researchers assessed a purported recording of the noise and said it matched the mating song of the Indies short-tailed cricket found around the Caribbean. The actual cause of the diplomats ' ailments was outside the scope of the study.

Scientists studying recordings made by U.S. diplomats of the unusual high-pitched sounds say the source is the common Caribbean cricket. The sounds reportedly triggered symptoms such as headaches , nausea and hearing loss for over two years. While they believe they 've confirmed the source of the recording published by the Associated Press , the scientists do n't have answers for why the sounds triggered such harmful symptoms in the diplomats.

A recording of a mysterious sound heard by U.S. embassy workers in Cuba has been studied. The sound matches the chirp of a certain species of cricket, researchers say. In late 2016, American diplomats and intelligence officers started reporting strange symptoms. The State Department says the symptoms include hearing loss, memory issues and mild traumatic brain injury.

US President Donald Trump is edging closer to declaring a national emergency to fund his long-promised border wall. Some 800,000 workers were to miss their first paycheck on Friday under the stoppage. Washington was close to setting a dubious record for the longest government shutdown in the nation 's history.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are still furloughed from their jobs or are working without pay. This shutdown is causing extreme hardship for these dedicated public servants and their families. The U.S. House of Representatives has twice approved appropriations to reopen government. But the Senate and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have refused to act on the House-approved bills.

US President Donald Trump has visited the US border in Mexico today. He met with US border patrol agents and made the case for his border-wall with Mexico. A stand-off over the president 's request for $ 5 billion in funding for the wall has left the US Government in a state of partial shutdown.

Hundreds of federal workers across the country organized demonstrations to rally against the government shutdown. In Washington, Democratic lawmakers joined union leaders and their federal government members calling for an end to a shutdown. At least four other rallies were held in Detroit, Dallas, Ogden, Utah and there was a second in Washington.

The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction barring the government from requiring employees to report for work without pay during the shutdown. The lawsuit also claims that the government violated the plaintiffs ' Fifth Amendment rights by limiting their ability to seek alternative employment. Two federal employees unions have already sued the Trump administration over the partial government shutdown.

Government employees have set up roughly 1,000 fundraising pages, GoFundMe told The Guardian. Campaigns on the crowdfunding platform seek anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. The campaigns have raised approximately $ 100,000 in total, The Guardian reported. The government shutdown started in December because the House and Senate could n't come to agreement.

About 31,000 teachers, nurses, counselors and librarians took to picket lines on a rainy Monday in Los Angeles. The nation 's second-biggest school system is using substitutes and staff to keep school doors open. About 400 substitutes and 2,000 credentialed district staff are trying to cover for the union members.

About 640,000 students arriving on Monday for classes in the Los Angeles County School District were met by teachers carrying picket signs and rallying in the rain. The union wants a 6.5 percent pay rise, more librarians, counsellors and nurses on campuses, smaller class sizes and less testing. Talks broke down on Friday when union bargaining chair Arlene Inouye said she and her fellow negotiators were insulted by the latest contract offer.

A teachers strike scheduled to begin Monday appears imminent. United Teachers Los Angeles on Friday rejected a revised offer by the L.A. Unified School District. The strike is scheduled to start at 8:30 a.m. Monday in Los Angeles, the district's website says.

Former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is urging the LAUSD and the union representing its teachers to avoid a massive teachers ' strike. United Teachers Los Angeles ( UTLA) held a roundtable Saturday after announcing its members will strike on Monday. It would be the first such strike in 30 years for the second largest school district in the nation.

More than 30,000 Los Angeles teachers could go on strike on Monday. Half a million students would be affected. The strike is the result of failed negotiations between the LA teachers ' union and school district. 'This Is Our Life' is CNN's weekly, offbeat look at life in the U.S.

The Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers are at an impasse yet again. Teachers are demanding smaller class sizes, school nurses and higher wages. These goals would be realistic if LAUSD had the funding - but it does n't. A tax hike would effectively increase funding and meet teachers ' demands.

Thousands of Los Angeles teachers plan to strike Monday - raising the possibility of a new wave of educator spring activity in the blue state of California. The labor unrest in LA is reminiscent of statewide teacher walkouts last year in the red states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arizona. The battle in Los Angeles features a more traditional labor fight that pits the United Teachers Los Angeles union against district leaders.

United Teachers Los Angeles previously said its 35,000 members would walk off the job Thursday. A judge was considering Wednesday whether the union gave legally proper notice of a strike. The Los Angeles district has offered a 6 percent raise over the first two years of a three-year contract. The union wants significantly smaller class sizes and more nurses.

Schellenburg was dispatched to Dalian by drug traffickers in November 2014 to orchestrate smuggling of more than 222 kilograms ( 489.4 pounds ) of methamphetamine from the Chinese port city to Australia.

Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was originally given 15 years in prison for drug smuggling. He was sentenced to death in China on Monday after a one-day retrial. The 36-year-old said he was a tourist in China when he was duped by a man he believed was a translator.

A Canadian man accused of drug smuggling in China faced a new trial Monday after an upper court called for a harsher sentence.

Earth 's magnetic field is behaving erratically. The planet 's shifting magnetic poles could cause navigational problems. Scientists think the magnetic field 's erratic behavior is explained by changes in the flow of iron inside Earth 's outer core. But it 's also possible Earth's magnetic poles are on the verge of reversing.

Magnetic North Pole Shifting Rapidly and Unpredictably Credit : Captain David '' Duke '' Snider. The World Magnetic Model predicts the Earth 's geomagnetic field for the next five years. It is normally produced every five years, but the 2015 update has been postponed due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

Earth 's north magnetic pole has been rapidly shifting away from Canada and towards the Siberian Federal District. The magnetic pole is moving so quickly that it has forced the world 's geomagnetism experts into a rare move. On January 30 ( delayed due to the US Government shutdown ) the World Magnetic Model ( WMM) will be updated.

Earth 's magnetic field is behaving erratically. The planet 's shifting magnetic poles could cause navigational problems. Scientists think the magnetic field 's erratic behavior is explained by changes in the flow of iron inside Earth 's outer core. But it 's also possible Earth's magnetic poles are on the verge of reversing.

Earth 's north magnetic pole is on the move, unpredictably lurching away from the Canadian Arctic and toward Siberia. The current representation of the entire globe 's magnetic field , just updated in 2015 , is now out of date. This updated model, called the World Magnetic Model, was supposed to be published Jan. 15, but it 's now been delayed to Jan. 30.

The magnetic north pole is shifting at an unprecedented rate. Rapid and erratic movements of the north magnetic pole have prompted an early update to a model that assists with navigation. The scheduled fix was supposed to happen on January 15 , but the U.S. government shutdown has forced an unwelcome delay.

The magnetic north pole is shifting at a faster rate than at any time in human history. The pole is constantly on the move due to changes in the planet 's molten core, which contains iron. In the last decade alone, movement has increased by a third, throwing off compasses by roughly 1 degree every five years.

McLaren Automotive will open another new chapter in the story of its Longtail ( LT ) family. The new model will further broaden the level of choice for McLaren customers - although with a production run of just 12 months , buyers will need to move quickly. Further information and images of the new LT will be revealed online on Wednesday January 16, 2019 at 13:00 GMT.

Earth 's north magnetic pole is on the move, unpredictably lurching away from the Canadian Arctic and toward Siberia. The current representation of the entire globe 's magnetic field, updated in 2015, is now out of date. Geologists have come up with a new model that will inform a wide array of navigation.

 Compass needles point towards the north magnetic pole, a point which has crept unpredictably from the coast of northern Canada a century ago to the middle of the Arctic Ocean. A five-year update of a World Magnetic Model was due in 2020 but the U.S. military requested an unprecedented early review. The wandering pole is driven by unpredictable changes in liquid iron deep inside the Earth.



At least 21 people have been murdered in Haiti after a group of men in uniform opened fire on unarmed residents in an impoverished neighbourhood.

Judge Orders Trump Administration To Remove 2020 Census Citizenship Question. Judge Jesse Furman found that the decision by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census was unlawful. Furman left open the possibility that Ross might be able to move forward with the question if he were to meet specific requirements.

An expert in surveys says adding a citizenship question to the U.S. Census would worsen the undercount of Latinos and non-citizens. Colm O'Muircheartaigh testified on Monday at the start of a trial in San Francisco before a federal judge. Judge Richard Seeborg is scheduled to hear a week of testimony starting Monday.

A trial will begin Monday in federal court in San Francisco over the Trump administration 's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census. A professor at the University of Chicago said the question would reduce the percentage of Latinos and non-citizens who respond to the census questionnaire. Figures from the census are used to determine the distribution of congressional seats to states and billions of dollars in federal funding.

California and cities are suing the U.S. government to keep the question off the population count. Colm O'Muircheartaigh said the question would reduce the percentage of Latinos and non-citizens who respond to the census questionnaire. Figures from the census are used to determine the distribution of congressional seats to states.

Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross was shielded by the Supreme Court from having to tell lawyers why he wants to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Ross announced the addition of the citizenship question last March , but it has been tied up in court. Opponents contend fears of deportation among undocumented immigrants will cause them to be undercounted.

U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman says such a question would be constitutional. The ruling came in a case in which a dozen states or big cities and immigrants ' rights groups argued that adding the question might frighten immigrant households away from participating in the census. A separate suit on the same issue , filed by the state of California , is underway in San Francisco.

A federal judge on Tuesday set aside U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross 's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire.

British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May 's Brexit divorce deal by crushing margin. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called a vote of no confidence in May's government. With May vowing to stand by her deal and Labour trying to trigger a national election, parliament is still effectively deadlocked.

MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the prime minister 's deal. It sets out the terms of Britain 's exit from the EU on 29 March. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has now tabled a vote of no confidence in the government. The confidence vote is expected to be held at about 1900 GMT on Wednesday.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will warn against a defeat of her deal in Parliament. She will argue that Parliament has a duty to implement the 2016 referendum in favor of leaving the EU. Despite her forceful words, May is likely facing a defeat - her bill is unpopular with both pro and anti-Brexit MPs.

Officers from police forces on several electorates have quietly stepped up patrols. Specific MPs have been warned to take extra care as they are targeted by far-right protesters. The warnings come ahead of a crucial week for the nation and Prime Minister Theresa May. But tabloid the Daily Star summed up the feelings of many British people with its treatment of the Brexit issue.

Cross-party group of anti-Brexit MPs publish draft legislation for creating a route to a referendum on Theresa May 's deal. MPs including senior Conservative backbencher Dominic Grieve, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and Labour's Chuka Umunna are backing two pieces of proposed legislation. People 's Vote campaigners estimate that 175 out of the 650 MPs in the Commons support another referendum.

Officers from police forces on several electorates have quietly stepped up patrols. Specific MPs have been warned to take extra care as they are targeted by far-right protesters. The warnings come ahead of a crucial week for the nation and Prime Minister Theresa May. But tabloid the Daily Star summed up the feelings of many British people with its treatment of the Brexit issue.

Hard-line Brexiteers are pushing for Britain to leave the European Union with no deal. Parliament is scheduled for a historic vote Tuesday evening on Prime Minister Theresa May's deal. Without May 's two , maybe three years of negotiated transition, Britain would be treated by the EU as a third country.

Cross-party group of MPs wants Theresa May to give Parliament a greater say in deciding how Britain leaves the EU. MPs are to vote on Mrs May 's deal tomorrow night, with No 10 braced for a defeat by an unprecedented majority of more than 200. Draft law could in theory be tabled as early as Monday next week if Mrs May loses tomorrow and she has to come back to the Commons with a new plan for delivering Brexit.

Cross-party group of senior backbenchers will seek to demolish Mrs May 's Government if she loses the vote on Tuesday. The group is looking to change Commons rules so that motions proposed by backbencher take priority over parliamentary business. Mrs May's team uncovered the plot last Thursday and fears the coup would enable MPs to suspend Article 50 and possibly overturn referendum result.

MP GUY OPPERMAN explains why he is backing the PM all the way. Says it is a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and protects jobs and the economy. Also gives us complete control over our immigration policy, our laws and our money. Many Labour MPs want to ignore the result and have a re-run.



UK Prime Minister Theresa May has seen off a bid to remove her government from power. She won a no-confidence vote by 325 to 306, including 10 votes from the DUP. Rebel Tory MPs and the DUP voted to keep her in Downing Street. Mrs May will be making a statement from Downing Street at around 2200 GMT.

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry appeared to acknowledge that Jeremy Corbyn 's widely expected move to seek a vote of no confidence in the government tonight was unlikely to succeed. Ms Thornberry said that if Labour were to back a fresh referendum in the coming days and weeks , it would be because of Mrs May.

Jeremy Corbyn ready to table a no confidence motion straight after the meaningful vote on Tuesday. He intends to hold the vote on Wednesday afternoon , shortly after Prime Minister 's Questions. The debate could be limited to just 90 minutes before MPs are asked to cast their votes. Should a majority vote in favour of the motion , the Government will fall.

The Prime Minister has written to the council about the planned Vicus Way multi-storey. Residents worry it will affect their quality of life if the commuter car park plans are green lit. The planning application is due to be reconsidered after Maidenhead Development Management Panel chairman Derek Wilson accidentally cast his deciding vote for refusal at a December meeting.

MPs will vote on Theresa May 's Withdrawal Agreement in Parliament this evening. It is expected to be heavily defeated - with objections from all sides. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could trigger a vote of no confidence in the government. Here is what you need to know about a no confidence motion.

Theresa May is set to lose a vote on her Brexit deal tonight - potentially by the biggest margin ever recorded. Jeremy Corbyn will say this is proof she does not have the confidence of the House. He has resisted demands for weeks to call a vote - insisting it will only happen when he is sure he will win.

There is nothing illegal, treasonous or unusual about a no-confidence motion. A government can be lawfully removed either by elections or by the votes of those whom the people elected to represent their interests. The Cabinet is bound by the principle of collective responsibility to the National Assembly. The government stays in office until elections are held and a new government elected.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the House of Commons that Theresa May 's 'catastrophic ' defeat represented an 'absolutely decisive ' verdict. He said he has tabled a vote of confidence in the government. May has told MPs the government will make time for a confidence vote on Wednesday after she suffered a humiliating defeat.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a motion of no confidence in the government. MPs will be asked to vote on a motion on Wednesday at 7pm. This gives Mrs May less than 24 hours to fight for her job. A defeat for Mrs May is not a surefire outcome. The government would fall and there would be a period of 14 days in which a new government can be formed.

Labour leader tabled historic vote of no confidence in the government. Move comes after PM's humiliating defeat in the House of Commons. Vote expected to be held tomorrow at around 7pm after all-day debate. If successful it will trigger a two-week countdown to a general election campaign.

Foreign auditors are to meet next week in Greece for a post-bailout review. The catalyst for the challenge to Mr. Tsipras 's government was a proposal to rename the neighboring nation of Macedonia. Greece had long blocked Macedonia from joining NATO , insisting that the country 's name implied territorial claims to the Greek region.

Greece 's parliament has scheduled a confidence vote for late Wednesday. The vote follows the collapse of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras ' governing coalition. The nationalist Independent Greeks party ended its four-year partnership with Syriza party on Sunday. The government now needs the backing of six lawmakers from opposition parties or independents.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Sunday he will ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament this week. The move comes after the country 's defense minister resigned over the Macedonia name deal. Greece and Macedonia agreed last June to a deal that would change the name of Greece 's northern neighbor to North Macedonia.

Greek officials predict Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will survive a no-confidence vote this week. The vote comes after defense minister Panos Kammenos resigned and pulled his nationalist ANEL party from the ruling coalition.

Kammenos 's decision to expel Tourism Minister Elena Kountoura and Deputy Agriculture Minister Vassilis Kokkalis from the party 's parliamentary group has handed Tsipras two crucial additional votes.

The Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab has targeted Kenya with several devastating assaults in recent years.

The massacre of at least 21 civilians by a unit of Al-Shabaab fighters at a hotel in Nairobi is the third major attack on the Kenyan state within the last five years. While the official Al- Shabaab explanation is that it is retaliatory action for Kenya 's military intervention in Southern Somalia, there is a masking of broader Al- shabaab strategy. This is to destabilise the neighbouring states to Somalia with Somali-speaking minority populations.

30 civilians of the Dahoussahak community in the Menaka region have reportedly been killed and two others injured. Less than a month ago , the same community was victim of a similar attack which left 48 civilians dead. Violence is also spreading to the Gao region where three civilians were killed and seven injured.

Mali 's prime minister has traveled to the northern rebel stronghold of Kidal. It is the first such trip since a now stalled peace deal was signed in 2015. Northern Mali has seen violence not only from separatists but also from radical jihadists. The last time a prime minister visited Kidal was in 2014 , when his delegation was in the center of bloody clashes.

China confirms birth of gene-edited babies, blames scientist He Jiankui for breaking rules. China confirms births of gene edited babies. China says scientist broke rules by altering DNA of human embryos. China blames scientist for breaking the country's rules on gene-editing.

Chinese authorities hold scientist He Jiankui wholly responsible for creating the world 's first gene-edited babies. He forged ethical review papers and recruited eight couples to participate in his experiment, resulting in two pregnancies. One of the mothers gave birth to twins nicknamed Lulu and Nana. Another woman is still carrying a gene- edited fetus.

China says doctor behind gene edited babies acted on his own. Dr. He Jiankui organized and handled funding for the experiment without outside assistance. Along with the birth of the twins , Lulu and Nana , another embryo yet to be born resulted from He 's experiment.

Dr. He Jiankui organized and handled funding for the experiment without outside assistance. He will be punished for any violations of the law, Xinhua News Agency says.

The flash of a meteor impact is visible at lower left in this gorgeous shot of the Super Blood Wolf Moon. The lunar surface acquires an average of 140 new craters a year. NASA has a team dedicated to monitoring these flashes because they can teach us about the debris.

This year 's total eclipse will be all the more rare as it is the first to be seen in its entirety in North America in three and half years. North and South America will have the best seats to watch the cosmic event. It is highly recommended to catch the Super Blood Wolf Moon as the next one arrives in May 26 , 2021.

The total eclipse will begin minutes before midnight on the East Coast ( 0500 GMT ) and just before 9 p.m. in the West. Total lunar eclipses occur when the moon moves into perfect alignment with the sun and earth. If skies are clear, the phenomenon can be seen with the naked eye and no protection is needed.

Some people are referring to this moon as the `` Super Blood Wolf Moon '' The moon is a combination of three different factors all aligning on the same night. It is also known as the "super blood wolf moon" or the "blood moon" The moon will be visible to the naked eye for the first time in nearly a decade.

A total lunar eclipse will be visible in the US, Canada, South America, parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. The eclipse will shine at a maximum 1.20 magnitude at 7:12 p.m. and the entire event will end at 9:48 p. m. The moon is below the horizon in Hawai ' i some of the time, so that part of the eclipse is not visible.

The Jan. 20 total lunar eclipse falls under the sign of Leo. Leo is the galactic guardian of creativity, glamour, romance, and fertility. The Leo energy associated with this phenomenon will help the twins gravitate toward a powerful partner. The full moon might make you feel a longing to get closer to your loved ones.

A total lunar eclipse is set to take place in the early hours of Monday morning. Astronomers and skygazers are particularly interested in this year 's blood moon as it is the last of its kind for two years. Weather permitting, the eclipse should be visible from the UK for a reasonable amount of time. The best time is around 5.12am to catch the maximum eclipse.

A total lunar eclipse will grace the skies on January 20-21 night. The cosmic event occurs when Sun , Earth and Moon are aligned with Earth between the other two. Total lunar eclipse makes the moon appear reddish in colour which is why it is known as a blood moon. January will mark the first lunar eclipse of 2019 on 20th and this will also be the last total lunar Eclipse until 2021.

A Super Blood Wolf Moon will be visible in North and South America and western parts of Europe and Africa. The moon will undergo a total lunar eclipse, also known as a blood moon. This is caused by the moon entering the Earth 's shadow and turning a rusty color from scattered sunlight particles.

Lunar eclipse will be visible across the U.S. as long as cloud cover is n't an issue. Total eclipse will begin at 11:41 p.m. and reach totality at 12:12 a.m . From there , it remains a total lunar eclipse until 12:43 a.M.

The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump to enforce his policy of banning certain transgender people from the military. The court voted 5-4 to grant a Trump administration request to lift injunctions blocking the policy while challenges continue in lower courts. The policy prohibits transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition from serving.

The high court on Tuesday reversed lower-court orders preventing the Pentagon from implementing its plans. But the high court for now declined to take up cases about the plan. The cases will continue to move through lower courts. Military policy had barred service by transgender people until President Obama began allowing transgender people already in the military to serve openly.

New York state has enacted strong new legal protections for abortion rights. The new law safeguards rights laid out in Roe v. Wade and other court rulings. The Reproductive Health Act replaces a 1970 state abortion law that was passed three years before Roe legalized abortion nationwide. Republicans who opposed the bill offered proposals to create new legal penalties for harming pregnant women.

The push comes partly as a reaction to the confirmation last October of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Abortion opponents want Justice Kavanaugh at some point to provide the decisive vote striking down Roe v. Wade. The 1973 ruling established a constitutional right to early-term abortions.

Roe v. Wade was a resounding victory for women, for their families and for the doctors who had been previously barred from providing the full spectrum of reproductive health care - including safe and legal abortion. Since 2011, over 400 bills have been signed into law that directly restrict abortion access. These barriers to care disproportionately impact women of color, women in rural areas and those with low incomes.

The Reproductive Health Act would bring New York 's abortion laws in line with rights guaranteed under Roe v. Wade. Abortion also would be regulated in New York under public health law, instead of penal law. Gov. Andrew Cuomo promised during his 2018 campaign to sign the bill in the first 30 days of the legislative session.

For the first time since Roe v. Wade, the House of Representatives has a majority supporting abortion rights. This new Democratic majority is more liberal - at least on reproductive rights for women - than its predecessors. But the Senate, while nominally opposed to abortion rights, does not vote to advance further restrictions.

The Reproductive Health Access Project ( RHAP) has been organizing trainings like this since 2005. RHAP's philosophy ? Information is power. Abortion is so politicized and stigmatized , but a lot of people do n't really know what it entails. The SIA Legal Team is a band of lawyers aiding women who pursue self-managed abortions.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the sweeping legislation is a rare opportunity to update a state law. The state 's Reproductive Health Act had been blocked by Senate Republicans for the better part of a decade. Now with the Assembly and Senate under Democratic control , Cuomo vowed to pass the bill and sign it into law.

The majority of Republicans were supporters of abortion rights through the 1960s and 1970s. But after Roe v. Wade secured abortion as a constitutional right in 1973, the party shifted dramatically toward opposing abortion. This shift in the GOP 's position on abortion policy was part of an effort to revive the party.

New York legislators are expected to pass the Reproductive Health Act Tuesday. The act will update a state law that limits when women can legally get an abortion. It also will decriminalize abortion by regulating it under the public health law. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign the bill into law.

The Reproductive Health Act is then expected to be signed into law later Tuesday at the state Capitol by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The vote Tuesday comes on the anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade court case in 1973. In addition to the abortion bill, the Democratic-controlled Legislature will also pass the Comprehensive Contraception Coverage Act.



Angola has finally shed the divisive 'vices against nature' provision in its law. The government has also prohibited discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation.

Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the offer of temporary protection for about a million undocumented immigrants a 'non-starter' Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell will bring up legislation as early as Tuesday containing the President 's proposal plus billions in disaster relief.

Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons released statements Jan. 19 regarding President Donald Trump 's speech on the government shutdown.

Jean Wyllys said he was currently outside of Brazil and had no plans to return after a growing number of threats over the past year. He was a close friend of Marielle Franco, the gay Rio councilwoman who was shot and killed along with her driver in March. His departure is likely to add to fears among Brazil 's LGBT community that homophobia is set to rise even further.

Even when cities seem progressive on the surface , the lived experience of members of the LGBT community can tell a dramatically different story. This year 's Bogotá Pride march was marked by an undertone of resistance to the right-wing government of the new president, Ivan Duque. Duque openly opposes the LGBT-inclusive peace agreement his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos , signed with leftist rebels Farc in 2016.

Bernie Sanders has spent a quarter century in Congress as the quintessential , minimally effective gadfly. The question has consumed the Democratic Party and liberal politics in general for close to three years now: What does Bernie want ? Today, the question has taken its most urgent and consequential form to date. What does Sanders want to do in the 2020 presidential race ?

Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) on Thursday spoke out against the U.S. government 's long history of intervening inappropriately in Latin America. Sanders criticized President Nicolas Maduro for his violent crackdown on opposition protesters and violations of the country 's constitution. Sanders has yet to announce whether or not he'll run for president in 2020.

Sanders, 77, plans to announce his presidential bid imminently, Yahoo News reports. Early polls of the race have shown him as one of the top candidates in the Democratic primary field. Sanders forcefully denounced President Trump as a 'racist ' on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in South Carolina.

Independent senator Sanders, 77, plans to announce his presidential bid imminently, Yahoo News reports. Early polls of the race have shown him as one of the top candidates in the Democratic primary field. His 2016 campaign was considered a success , even though he fell short to the eventual nominee, Hillary Clinton. Sanders forcefully denounced President Trump as a 'racist ' on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in South Carolina.

Bernie Sanders plans to announce his presidential bid imminently, according to two sources quoted by Yahoo News. The self-described democratic socialist is making another run for the White House. Sanders was defeated by Hillary Clinton in the last Democratic primary race, which leaked emails revealed was rigged against him. Sanders' campaign reshaped the Democratic Party, with many of his policies now centerpieces of the progressive wing of the party.



The people of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM) voted to ratify the law creating a new Bangsamoro region. A majority of ARMM voters chose to approve theBangsamoro Organic Law ( BOL ) or Republic Act 11054 on Monday, January 21. On Friday evening, January 25, the National Plebiscite Board of Canvassers announced that the BOL was deemed ratified. Cotabato City and Isabela City voted to join the BARMM on Monday. The BOL will replace the ARMM, which has been called a failed experiment because of its dependence on the national government in Metro Manila.

 unofficial results show a majority voted for a Muslim homeland in the region via a Jan. 21 referendum. Cotabato Mayor Frances Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi had campaigned strongly against her city 's inclusion in the autonomous area. She argued that giving a former rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) full control of the city could lead to violence.

Sulu is so far the only ARMM territory to have voted against the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law , but this has no impact on the region for now. The other ARMM provinces - Maguindanao , Lanao del Sur , Basilan , Tawi-Tawi - ratified it during the January 21 plebiscite.

The turnout in a referendum on the autonomy of Bangsamoro exceeded 85 percent. Preliminary results of the Philippine election commission Comelec indicate a majority `` yes '' vote. The Muslim-majority region in the southern Philippines is part of a peace agreement with separatist groups.

More than two million Filipinos residing in several Muslim-majority regions of the country cast their votes on the establishment of a new Muslim-dominated entity. The referendum comes six years after the historic peace agreement that ended the decades-long war between the Philippine government and Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) If approved by the majority in the referendum, the proposed political entity will replace the much smaller Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM ) The election went broadly peaceful and was deemed by international observers as credible.

A well-organized grassroots campaign , coupled with support from Catholics and the national government , made the big win possible. The Bangsamoro Organic Law ( BOL) was declared ratified on Friday, January 25. We cite 5 factors including years of grassroots organizing, women's door-to-door campaign, messaging among communities and online. Deployment of unarmed MILF members to protect votes.

The historic vote creates the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao , a more powerful political entity that allows the BangSamoro people a chance at genuine self-governance. The BOL is a culmination of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front 's 40-year struggle for autonomy.

Voters have decisively approved a new Muslim-led region in the Philippines ' south. Results mean rebel group Moro Islamic Liberation Front will start laying down its weapons and assuming political power. About 150,000 people were killed in the rebellion that began in 1970s and aimed to push the government to grant independence to a Muslim minority.

Voters have decisively approved a new Muslim-led region in the Philippines ' south. The results will begin the process of the nation 's largest rebel group laying down its weapons. About 150,000 people were killed in the rebellion that began in the 1970s. Rebels and the government in Manila hope a new peaceful Bangsamoro will draw investment.

A landmark law was ratified on Friday ( Jan 25 ) paving the way for the creation of an autonomous entity in Muslim-majority areas in the southern Philippines. The Bangsamoro Organic Law or BOL was the result of a peace deal signed between the government and the Philippines ' largest Muslim rebel group. The agreement raises hopes of ending four decades of fighting between government troops and the MILF.



Former West Virginia State Sen. Richard Ojeda ended his long-shot presidential bid on Friday. He was a leader of the state 's teachers strikes last year. He waged an unsuccessful bid for the House in 2018 , losing by 13 points in a district that Trump carried by 49 points two years earlier.

Greece 's parliament has voted narrowly to back a historic agreement ending a 27-year dispute over its northern neighbour 's name. Parliament agreed by 153 votes to 146 to approve the name Republic of North Macedonia, despite widespread opposition from the public. Opposition to the deal is strongest in the northern Greek region of Macedonia, and polls suggest more than 60 % of Greeks dislike it.

Greece 's parliament is poised to make a historic decision on Thursday night. Expectation is high that it will back a deal to rename its northern neighbour. If Greek MPs agree, the country that called itself Macedonia will be called the Republic of North Macedonia. It has taken 27 years of talks and protests continue to this day.

Greek MPs are due to vote today on whether to ratify a United Nations accord that would change the name of Greece 's northern neighbour to the Republic of North Macedonia. The Greek Government is facing a public and political backlash over the deal. Opposition parties argue it opens the possibility for their neighbour to make claims on Greek territory.

Nikola Dimitrov says supporters of Macedonia 's name-change deal with Greece are on the right side of history. The Greek parliament heads towards a tense vote this week on the agreement that would christen his Balkan country the Republic of North Macedonia. For more than a quarter-century, Athens has blocked Skopje from organisations like NATO and the EU because it claims exclusive rights to the name Macedonia for a province in northern Greece.

Greek lawmakers are expected to vote Thursday on a deal to change the name of neighbouring Macedonia. The debate began Wednesday and is to conclude late Thursday night with a vote on the Prespa Agreement. The deal aims to rename the former Yugoslav republic as the Republic of North Macedonia. Athens has objected to its neighbour being called Macedonia because it has a northern province of the same name.

France 's Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau says it would be difficult for the two countries to work together for the time being. Her remarks follow verbal attacks against French Presdient Emmanuel Macron from officials in Italy 's government in recent days. On Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio accused Paris of fuelling the flow of migrants to Europe.

5Stars leader Luigi Di Maio blamed French foreign policy for migrant deaths in Mediterranean. He said poverty in countries that use French currency and pay for French deficit. Italian opposition dismissed comments as lies and propaganda driven by coalition rivalry. 5Stars are keen to burnish their anti-establishment credentials ahead of May 's European election.

Tensions have flared between the two countries since the Five Star Movement and League party came to power in a coalition in Italy last June. Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio accused Paris of fuelling the migrant influx to Europe by continuing to colonise Africa. Italy 's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini poured fuel on the fire on Tuesday by referring to French President Emmanuel Macron.

Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since the far-right League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement formed a ruling coalition in Italy last year. Both men have since ramped up their anti-Macron rhetoric and taken turns to excoriate the young centrist in public. The latest verbal spat started on Saturday after Mr Di Maio tore apart France 's policies in Africa.

Paris and Rome have once again clashed over Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio 's remarks that France is responsible for the migrant crisis. French newspaper Le Figaro wrote that the latest row between France and Italy is evolving into a diplomatic crisis. Italian media outlet La Repubblica suggested that Rome had targeted France and French people, rather than President Emmanuel Macron and his party.

In the wake of Salvini calling for Macron to step down , a significant breach of diplomatic decorum , the French Foreign Ministry summoned Italy 's ambassador to Paris.



Shutdown ends as Trump signs short-term deal without wall funding. The 35-day closure was the longest in U.S. history. 800,000 federal employees were furloughed while the president and Democrats battled over the wall. The deal ends the longest-ever government shutdown.

House Democrats are preparing a package that would ignore U.S. President Donald Trump 's demand for $ 5.7 billion for a wall with Mexico. Details of Democrats ' border security plan and its cost remained a work in progress. Party leaders said it would include money for scanning devices and other technological tools for improving security.

Senate Republicans will try to muscle through the 1,300-page spending measure. It includes $ 5.7 billion to fund Trump 's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. No Democrat has publicly expressed support for the proposal Trump announced over the weekend. Another missed paycheck looms for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan was a featured speaker at a New England Council breakfast. She highlighted support for the military and education reform as her top legislative priorities. Trahan said she believes negotiations over the border should be kept separate from efforts to reopen the government.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that China wants to have a trade deal with the United States. Trump wants to reduce the massive trade deficit with China.

House Democrats are preparing a package that would ignore President Donald Trump 's demand for $ 5.7 billion for a wall with Mexico. Party leaders said it would include money for scanning devices and other technological tools for improving security at ports of entry and along the boundary. It came as the Senate prepared for Thursday votes on rival plans for reopening federal agencies.

Congress is struggling to cut a deal to reopen the federal government. President Donald Trump is refusing to sign off on any proposal that does not include $ 5.7 billion for his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The GOP-controlled Senate is set to take its first votes on competing Republican and Democratic plans to end the shutdown. Neither bill is expected to win the 60 votes needed for passage.

Competing bills appear likely to fail Thursday, caught in a poisonous Washington impasse. Republicans would couple ending the 34-day shutdown with $ 5.7 billion for border wall. Democrats would reopen agency doors for three weeks while bargainers seek a budget accord. Twin defeats might spur the two sides into a more serious effort to strike a compromise.

Nicolas Maduro 's Venezuelan regime was stymied in its bid to pull $ 1.2 billion worth of gold out of the Bank of England. Top U.S. officials lobbied their U.K. counterparts to help cut off the regime from its overseas assets, according to one of the people. The U.N. and other countries on Wednesday recognized Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

Britain rejected Venezuela 's request to withdraw $ 1.2bn in gold stored in the UK, according to reports. Bankers in Britain were allegedly concerned that Venezuelan officials would sell the state-owned gold for personal gain. Despite the fact that the story was not confirmed , the alleged move of the British bank was swiftly praised by the self-proclaimed 'interim president ' of Venezuela.

Nicolas Maduro 's regime was stymied in its bid to pull $ 1.2 billion worth of gold out of the Bank of England. The U.S. officials are trying to steer Venezuela 's overseas assets to Guaido. The European Union threatened to recognize Guaido unless a credible presidential election is called with eight days.

Gold has formed a crucial part of Venezuela 's foreign reserves for years. Hugo Chavez ploughed much of the country 's oil wealth into gold in part because of his disdain for the US dollar. In 2011 Chavez ordered the repatriation of $ 11 billion worth of gold bars from the Bank of England.

Sources say the Bank of England has cut off access to $ 1.2 billion of Venezuela 's gold assets from the regime of Nicolás Maduro. U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo allegedly lobbied their UK counterparts to deny Maduro access to his overseas assets. The funds represent a part of the some $ 8bn ( £6.06bn) held in foreign reserves by the Venezuelan central bank.



European powers have warned Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that he must call elections within eight days or they will officially recognise the opposition 's claim of leadership. Venezuela later rejected the ultimatum at a UN meeting, where divisions between world powers were laid bare. Mr Maduro is under pressure after his rival Juan Guaidó declared himself acting president on Wednesday. Several countries - including the US - already back Mr Guaidoó as president.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó says he would consider amnesty for President Maduro if he cedes power. He said he was reaching out to all sectors including the military to end the crisis. It comes amid US efforts to block Mr Maduro 's revenue streams. Mr Maduro has cut ties with the US and has so far been backed by the military.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has broken off relations with the US. Mr Maduro gave US diplomats 72 hours to leave the country but the US said the former president no longer had the authority to order them out. On Wednesday, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself president during mass protests. The US has urged the military to back Mr Guaidoó, but so far it has remained loyal to Mr Maduro.

Juan Guaidó was born one of seven children in La Guaira in the state of Vargas. He was 15 when Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999, and survived deadly floods. Opposition parties picked him to lead the National Assembly as a compromise candidate. He took up his post on 5 January, and was picked as head of legislative body just three weeks ago.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has said he would consider an amnesty for President Nicolás Maduro if he cedes power. Mr Maduro began a second term after polls marred by an opposition boycott and vote-rigging claims. The global community is split on whether to recognise his government. But so far, Mr Maduro retains the crucial support of Venezuela 's military. The US, more than a dozen Latin American countries, Canada and the UK have backed him. But Russia has condemned foreign support for him, saying it violates international law.

The governments of Germany and Spain have on Friday said that Venezuela should hold free and fair elections as soon as possible. If such a step were not taken , both countries would be willing to recognize self-proclaimed Venezuelan president Juan Guaidó. Steffen Seibert , the spokesman for the German executive , told journalists that Nicolás Maduro can not be the legitimate president of Venezuela.

The Russian contractors reportedly traveled on two charter flights that landed in Havana and from there they took commercial flights to Venezuela. The Russian contractors are believed to have been working for a state-owned oil company in Venezuela. They are also believed to be working for state-run oil company PDVSA.

Interim Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó suggested on Thursday that the nation 's opposition is open to discussing granting prosecutorial amnesty to dictator Nicolás Maduro and top officials. Guaido made the remark in his first interview since being sworn into the office of the presidency on Wednesday during nationwide protests against Maduro 's socialist regime. He also provided in that interview the first estimates of crowd sizes at Wednesday 's massive protests.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has rejected an offer of talks from President Nicolás Maduro. The two are locked in a power struggle amid an ongoing economic crisis. Mr Maduro began a second term earlier this month after polls marred by an opposition boycott. The international community is split on whether to recognise his government.

Canada 's ambassador to China admitted to an ill-timed and politically explosive slip of the tongue. John McCallum suggested detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou had a strong case to avoid extradition to the United States. Comment came just hours after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly defended him in the face of Conservatives demands to fire him. China 's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated its demand that Meng be released from her unjust detention.

China reiterates its demand that Meng be released from her unjust detention. Canada was acting on an extradition request from the U.S. China detained Kovrig and Spavor in the days that followed Meng 's Dec. 1 arrest. Western analysts believe their cases are part of an attempt by Beijing to pressure Canada.

Ambassador to China John McCallum walks back comments on Meng Wanzhou. He had suggested Meng had a strong case to avoid extradition to the U.S. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has publicly defended him in the face of Conservatives demands to fire him. China 's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated its demand that Meng be released.

Canada 's ambassador to China says he misspoke when he said Meng Wanzhou had a strong case against extradition to the United States. John McCallum said Meng had good arguments on her side in her case. Meng 's arrest in Vancouver on Dec 1 at the behest of the U.S. enraged China. The United States has until Jan 30 to formally request her extradition.

Huawei announced this week that sales of their smartphones and other devices grew by 50 percent in 2018 and hit a record high of US $ 52 billion. The manufacturer has fast become a force to be reckoned within the market, causing an upset in rankings when it surpassed Apple to become the world 's second biggest smartphone maker. Huawei now corners almost 16 percent of the global market , shipping 206 million units in 2018.

A senior Canadian official told the Star that the Trudeau government approached the Americans after Trump said in December he would n't hesitate to intervene in the Meng affair. The insider said the American side agreed the two detained Canadians should be released. But no one in the administration admitted Meng is a pawn in a larger dispute, the source said.

The Federal Trade Commission is working with China 's leading tech firm against its U.S. competitors. The FTC called a Huawei executive as its first witness in its case against Qualcomm. The case was brought to court just one week before Donald Trump 's inauguration. The best chance of avoiding the latter scenario is for the entire government to work together and cooperate.

 BCE and Telus have used Huawei gear extensively in their cellular networks. The two companies have also turned to the supplier in recent years to build fibre-optic home internet. The Canadian government is conducting a cybersecurity review on whether to permit the continued use of the Chinese supplier 's equipment for 5G networks.

Canada 's ambassador to China said he misspoke when he said Meng Wanzhou had a strong case against extradition to the United States. John McCallum said Ms Meng had good arguments on her side in her case. Ms Meng 's arrest in Vancouver on Dec 1 enraged China, which has called for the extradition case to be dropped.

Moscow is leading the charge among those who still view Mr.Maduro as Venezuela 's legitimate president. The Kremlin 's will and ability to compete appear limited.

The Kremlin has denied reports that private military contractors who carry out secret missions for Russia flew into Venezuela. Global superpowers split into two camps last week after the United States backed opposition leader Juan Guaido declaring himself president of Venezuela.

Prime Minister Theresa May says there is a route that can secure a majority in Parliament for leaving the EU with a deal. May said she would now seek to deal with concerns -- primarily from the rightwing of her own Conservative party -- over the backstop. The backstop is an insurance policy in the withdrawal deal to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Ireland dealt a blow on Sunday to British Prime Minister Theresa May 's attempts to break the deadlock over Brexit. Ireland said it would not accept any changes to an agreement aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland. Just 61 days before Britain is due to leave the European Union, May is trying to revive a withdrawal deal she agreed with the EU.

Representatives from Northern Ireland 's business, farming, trade union, community and voluntary sectors are travelling to London. Twenty representatives will speak directly to the leaders of Labour, Liberal Democrats and the SNP. The group has also invited Northern Ireland's 18 MPs to meet them. They say the need for a Brexit deal is critical to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU.

Britain is no closer to knowing the end result of its vote to leave the European Union. A raft of amendments to be voted on by MPs tomorrow threaten to further muddy the waters. A no-deal scenario threatens to trigger a recession in Britain and markedly slow the EU 's economic growth.

I appeared on the Andrew Marr Show for the paper review with Grace Blakeley. I said repeatedly I thought it was a terrible deal and that I 'd rather leave the EU with no deal. If I had been an MP , I would have voted against the deal in Parliament on 15 January. I still think it 's a pretty ropy deal , but I now think there is a chance to improve it. The most important thing is that in 61 days we actually do formally leave theEU.

A team of Israeli researchers say they have developed a concept that will pave the way to a cure for cancer. The CEO of the company behind the research told The Times of Israel on Tuesday that it has not published its research in medical journals. Several Israeli experts declined to comment on the claim, some precisely because they were not familiar with the research.

Team in Israel claim the antidote will work immediately and take just weeks to fully destroy the cancerous cells. Experts behind the drug - named MuTaTo - say it will also have next to no side effects. Last year there were 9.6million deaths from cancer worldwide, according to charity Cancer Research UK.

Experts behind the drug - named MuTaTo - say it will also have next to no side effects. Last year there were 9.6million deaths from cancer worldwide, according to charity Cancer Research UK.

A team of Israeli scientists claim they will likely develop a cure for cancer in the next year. The new treatment is being developed by Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies. The treatment will use a combination of cancer-targeting peptides and a toxin that will specifically kill cancer cells.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announces lung cancer treatment drug Tagrisso is to be listed on the PBS. Previously the drug would cost $ 8000 per prescription , or nearly $ 90,000 a year. Morrison says the cost to the government will be $ 96 million over the forward estimates.

A team of Israeli scientists believe they have found a complete cure for cancer. David Aridor says his company, Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies, has developed a cancer cure that will be effective from day one of diagnosis. Arido says the universal cure will also cost less than most other treatments on the market and works in less time.

A team of Israeli scientists believes a cure for cancer is within reach, even optimistically predicting that it will be found within a year. The team is working on MuTaTo , which according to the news outlet is comparable to a cancer antibiotic. The development has not been tested in humans yet, but according to Dan Aridor it has shown success in mice trials.

A team of scientists in Israel claim they 'll have a complete cure for cancer within a year. The treatment is essentially on the scale of a cancer antibiotic. The drug is based on SoAP technology, which involves the introduction of DNA coding for a protein. The rate of people dying from cancer in the United States seems to have dropped steadily for 25 years.

A small team of Israeli scientists think they might have found the first complete cure for cancer. An estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide each year. Every sixth death in the world is due to cancer , making it the second leading cause of death ( second only to cardiovascular disease )

By Thursday night, temperatures across much of the Midwest were expected to poke above zero. By the end of the weekend, meteorologists predicted as much as a 70- or 80-degree swing. Still, risks remained . A band of snow complicated travel on Thursday , and in the Northeast, officials warned of their own cold wave.

A blast of Arctic-chilled air from the polar vortex has reached the US. Temperatures drop to as low as -46C ( -50F ) in Chicago. Cities in the midwest opened warming shelters as temperatures plummeted. The polar vortex is a mass of freezing air that normally spins around the north pole. But this time it made its way south.

Polar vortex is an area of frigid air and low atmospheric pressure that has always existed over each of Earth 's poles. It usually strengthens during the winter and can sometimes grow or spill southward. Last month, air temperatures about 20 miles above the North Pole rapidly rose by about 125 degrees as warmer air flowed in from the south.

It usually strengthens during the winter and can sometimes grow or spill southward. Last month, air temperatures about 20 miles above the North Pole rapidly rose by about 125 degrees as warmer air flowed in from the south.

Temperatures in almost a dozen states stretching more than 1,200 miles ( 1,930 kilometers ) from the Dakotas to Ohio were forecast to be the coldest in a generation , if not on record. The cause is a swirl of arctic air that broke away from the polar vortex that usually encircles the North Pole. Wind chills made it seem as cold as -65 degrees Fahrenheit in one area of Minnesota. Chicago was expected to be colder than parts of Antarctica.

Last month, air temperatures about 20 miles above the North Pole rapidly rose by about 125 degrees as warmer air flowed in from the south.

Bitterly cold air is currently sweeping though northeast regions of the USA. The air has come from the Arctic and is said to be the coldest of this winter. There was travel chaos on the roads and rails on Wednesday morning as heavy snow fell in areas including Minneapolis, Chicago and Detroit.

Officials say temperatures could reach as low as -40C as the polar vortex spreads across the midwest and the east. On Wednesday morning Chicago was significantly colder than Antarctica. The polar vortex is expected to spread across the U.S. from the Midwest to the East Coast.

Polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding the north and south poles. When uneven warm air disrupts it from below , causing the jet stream to weaken and buckle, eddies of cold air are pushed down. This sends warmer air into Alaska and pushes cold winds down into the US Midwest and East Coast. Chicago is forecast to be as cold as parts of Antarctica.

Some areas of the country could be seeing the coldest weather in a generation. A polar vortex is a core of polar air spreading due to low pressure weakening. The spells can last up to several weeks , until the cold air mass returns to its prior state. In this instance, we are expecting the cold snap to last just a few days.



Astronomers used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study white dwarf stars within the globular cluster NGC 6752. In the outer fringes of the area observed with Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys a compact collection of stars was visible. After a careful analysis of their brightnesses and temperatures , the astronomers concluded that these stars did not belong to the cluster - which is part of the Milky Way - but rather they are millions of light-years more distant.

Bedin 1 is a 13 billion-year-old dwarf spheroidal galaxy in our cosmic neighborhood. Hubble was photographing the globular star cluster NGC 6752 when it 'accidentally' found Bedin 1. The astronomers behind this discovery describe it as 'the astronomical equivalent of a living fossil from the early universe'

Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study some of the oldest and faintest stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752 have made an unexpected finding. They discovered a dwarf galaxy in our cosmic backyard, only 30 million light-years away. The discovery is reported in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society : Letters.

A team of astronomers serendipitously discovered the galaxy while studying a globular star cluster. NASA says the dim galaxy is in our cosmic backyard at just 30 million light-years away. Bedin 1 is a fraction of the size of the Milky Way and is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

The fascinating galaxy lies 30 million light-years away , and could be 'the most isolated small dwarf galaxy discovered to date . ' Astronomers have just made an incredible discovery while scouring the sky with the Hubble Space Telescope. Hidden behind a distant star cluster , the scientists uncovered a never-before-seen dwarf galaxy located right in our cosmic backyard.

Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to study some of the oldest and faintest stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752 have made an unexpected finding. They discovered a dwarf galaxy in our cosmic backyard , only 30 million light-years away. From the properties of its stars astronomers were able to infer that the galaxy is around 13 billion years old - nearly as old as the Universe itself.

Astronomers studying distant, dim stars accidentally stumble upon an entirely undocumented galaxy. The tiny galaxy measures only around 3000 light-years at its greatest extent - a fraction of the size of the Milky Way. Further observations led the astronomers to deduce that the galaxy is roughly 13 billion years old , making it roughly as old as the MilkyWay.

The newly discovered galaxy has been named Bedin I - and it 's nearly as old as the Universe. The mission was to look for the faintest stars in NGC 6752 - a globular cluster 13,000 light-years away within the Milky Way 's halo. But in the distance - around 2,300 times more distant than the star they were aiming at -Bedin I was lurking. The galaxy is very low in metals - which indicates that it has a very old population of stars.

Apple says Facebook can no longer distribute an app that paid users to extensively track their phone and web use. Facebook paid about $ 20 a month to use the Facebook Research app. While Facebook says this was done with permission , the company has a history of defining permission loosely and obscuring what data it collects.

Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, announced Friday that he is running for president. Booker chose the first day of Black History Month to launch his campaign. He joins a crowded and growing Democratic field that is already the most diverse in history. Booker plans to head to Iowa February 8-9 and then to South Carolina on February 10.

LA Mayor Eric Garcetti says he wo n't run for president in 2020. Garcetti will not seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, slightly winnowing a field that is still likely to be large and unwieldy for a party desperate to oust President Donald Trump. The 47-year-old mayor sounded like a presidential candidate as recently as last week.

Poll : Kamala Harris picking up steam , but Joe Biden still dominates 2020 Democratic field. As US President Donald Trump faces intensifying scrutiny about possible connections to Russia, opposition Democrats are looking to 2020. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll of 685 self-identified Democrats administered from Jan. 25-27 found that Biden leads the field with 33 percent of the vote. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders came in second , at 15 percent , while Harris came in third , at 10 percent.

Up to two dozen notable and accomplished men and women who are diverse in every fashion could run for president in 2020. Joe Biden is the 850 pound gorilla lurking around the ring at this incipient stage. Elizabeth Warren is the sole ( all but ) declared candidate in this first group. Sherrod Brown is the only Democrat who can definitely win Ohio and Pennsylvania. Kirsten Gillibrand is a moderate who has moved steadily leftward after casting herself as a moderate.

There are nine candidates in the race so far, with nearly two dozen others still thinking about it. It 's a big change from 2016 when a total of five major Democratic candidates ran. The candidates come from different parts of the country and have differing approaches on how to win in 2020 and beat Trump.

The list of potential candidates for the 2020 US presidential race continues to grow as we get deeper into 2019. But who are the Democrat, Republican and independent candidates running in the election next year ? This is what we know so far. US President Donald Trump said he is not worried about Joe Biden potentially running for president.

Sen. Cory Booker would be one of the primary frontrunners for the Democratic nomination for president if he decides to run. Booker spoke at length about criminal justice reform and how the Democratic Party should lead on the issue. He also shared his thoughts about Harris 's historic run and if it is OK to call Donald Trump a racist. Booker: "I feel a real sense of urgency about this moment in American history"

New Jersey state senator flips from Republican to Democrat. Dawn Marie Addiego has represented South Jersey 's 8th District since 2010. She says she was not elected to be content in the role of loyal opposition. State Republican Party Chairman Doug Steinhardt slammed the defection.

President Donald Trump spoke to Guaidoó by phone Wednesday morning and reaffirmed support for his fight to regain democracy.

Venezuela is entering a new chapter of potential turmoil. The U.S. State Department updated its travel advisory to its highest level. The armed forces have been crucial to President Nicolás Maduro 's hold on power. A former general says he believes it 's unlikely the military will move away from Maduro.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó presented a new strategy on Thursday in Caracas. He said there is a way for his beloved country to get out of the crippling poverty that has turned millions of desperate Venezuelans into refugees. The 35-year-old engineer , who has the support of U.S. President Donald Trump , said the National Plan approved by the National Assembly is divided into three phases.

Juan Guaidó claims state security agents showed up at his apartment in Caracas. He says they asked for his wife, who owns the unit. Venezuelan police denied on Twitter that special agents had gone to his home. Guaidoó is pressing forward with establishing a transitional government.

The leader of Venezuela 's opposition party claims he has held secret talks with the military to win crucial backing in his bid to oust President Nicolás Maduro. The news comes after Juan Guaidó declared himself the country 's interim president and was immediately recognised by the US and several neighbouring Latin American countries. However , the superpowers of Russia and China support Maduro which is why military support is seen as key to him holding on to power.

German gas demand could rise by up to 8 percent in the period to 2022 to replace coal-fired power plants. Coal commission on Jan. 26 recommended that coal-burning capacity be more than halved by 2030. Nuclear reactors are also due to close by 2022. Germany is Europe's biggest gas market as half of its home heating infrastructure relies on gas.

With North America and Europe closing down their old coal and nuclear plants, major gas exporters like Qatar can and should gain market share. The typical predictions for the global power sector see gas growing strongly, nuclear slowly and coal flat-lining or shrinking. Scenarios of strong climate action do not help nuclear much, are negative for coal and somewhat negative for gas.

Montana 's coal industry is in flux. Conservationists blame the market 's move away from fossil fuels. Industry leaders blame strict regulations. Montana has the largest coal reserve in the U.S. and 75 percent of coal leaves the state. The state is grappling with how to move forward in this fast-changing market.

President Trump did n't mention coal once in his State of the Union speech last night. He touted oil and natural gas as having unleashed a revolution in American energy. But recent projections from the Energy Information Administration show that coal may have reached a point of no return. Coal capacity retirements doubled in 2018 compared to 2017 and coal production was largely flat.

A new theory from NASA suggests that Moon consists of materials found on Earth and not from the Martian-sized celestial body. NASA 's research is based on analysis made recently from samples collected from the Moon during the Apollo missions. The approach simulates the process of Moon 's formation using 14 volatile metal elements found in the samples.

Asteroid 2019 BB5 will swing past the Earth on February 8 at 10.18am GMT ( UTC) The space rock will reach its closest possible distance to the Earth. Asteroid BB5 measures somewhere in the range of 39ft to 91.8ft (12m to 28m)

NASA said the duo are no longer communicating from their positions a million and two million miles from Earth. The US space agency launched Cubesats MarCO-A and B - nicknamed WALL-E and EVE - in May. The briefcase-sized craft rode on the Insight Mars Lander, detaching shortly after leaving orbit.

NASA said the duo are no longer communicating from their positions a million and two million miles from Earth. The US space agency launched Cubesats MarCO-A and B - nicknamed WALL-E and EVE - in May. The briefcase-sized craft rode on the Insight Mars Lander, detaching shortly after leaving orbit.

Two CubeSats were launched together with InSight and acted as test subjects for future missions. NASA said this week it lost contact with the pair as far back as December last year. Currently, Wall-E is more than 1 million miles ( 1.6 million km ) past Mars and Eve even further.

Twin CubeSats shadowed NASA 's InSight lander to Mars last year. The briefcase-size satellites flew past the red planet. They provided real-time updates to controllers in this first-of-its-kind experiment. This week, NASA said it has n't heard from them for more than a month now.

The furor over Amazon moving to Long Island City does n't seem to be dissipating. The point of some of the opposition might be to get more concessions from Amazon. State Sen.

Vanessa Tyson accused Justin Fairfax of engaging in a smear campaign against her. Tyson's attorneys earlier represented Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who testified that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school get-together in the early 1980s. Tyson is currently on leave from Scripps College and is a visiting fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

Vanessa Tyson, an associate professor of politics at Scripps College in Southern California, has accused Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexually assaulting her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Tyson hired lawyers at the law firm Katz , Marshall & Banks - the same team that represented Christine Blasey Ford , who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Fairfax has threatened to sue people who continue to spread these false allegations.

The state of Virginia was mired in uncertainty Tuesday as its governor remained conflicted over his political future. Allies of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam say he will continue to try to wait out the firestorm that has engulfed his office in recent days. Northam met with his top staff on Monday to consider his future , telling them he needs more time to consider what he will do next.

Embattled Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on Tuesday resisted calls to step down over a racist photo on his 1984 medical school yearbook page. The state 's main Democratic Latino organization joined the chorus urging his resignation. The first-term Democrat came under fire on Friday when a conservative media website released the photo. Northam has vowed to finish his four-year term.

Vanessa Tyson, an associate professor of politics at Scripps College in Southern California, has accused Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexually assaulting her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Fairfax, 39, has repeatedly denied Tyson 's claim and called it a 'smear' Tyson hired lawyers at the law firm Katz , Marshall & Banks - the same team that represented Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.

Vanessa Tyson is a Stanford University fellow scheduled to appear at a symposium next week on sexual violence and the # MeToo movement.

Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax says he had a consensual one-night stand with his accuser in 2004. He says it was years later that she objected to their encounter and made him the victim of a political smear. The accusation of sexual misconduct swamped Mr. Fairfax as he waited in the wings for Gov. Ralph Northam to resign.

Virginia Governor Ralph Northam is under fire over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook. Northam initially apologized and conceded he was one of the two people in the photo. He changed his story a day later and acknowledged he had dressed in blackface once before to portray Michael Jackson.

Tucker Carlson: In the space of just a few months , the standard for believing sexual assault accusers has changed completely. He says that Justin Fairfax 's Democratic colleagues are standing with him and against his accuser. Carlson: They no longer believe all women . Not anymore. The irony here is unbelievable . But it 's definitely not worthy of print . Just so you know the standard.



The United States is holding direct communications with members of Venezuela 's military. The U.S. is also preparing new sanctions aimed at increasing pressure on Maduro.

Bruce McArthur will be eligible to apply for parole after spending at least 25 years in prison for the murders of eight men in Toronto, a judge ordered on Friday. Ontario Superior Court Justice John McMahon noted the gruesomeness of McArthur 's crimes, but said there is a fine line between retribution and vengeance. He also told the packed University Avenue courtroom that there is very little chance the former landscaper will ever be granted parole. McArthur, 67, will be 91 when his first chance at parole comes up.

Criminology experts say Bruce McArthur 's age may have played a role in how he evaded suspicion. McArthur, now 67, pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder Tuesday morning. He is the oldest confirmed serial killer in Canadian history. Police spoke to McArthur in 2013 or early 2014, around the same time they were investigating the disappearances of three men.

Bruce McArthur pleaded guilty on Jan. 29 to eight counts of first-degree murder. He sexually assaulted , killed and dismembered men he met in Toronto 's Gay Village district for over seven years. He faces a potential sentence of life in prison with no chance for parole for 25 years or more.

Bruce McArthur pleaded guilty on Jan. 29 to eight counts of first-degree murder. He sexually assaulted , killed and dismembered men he met in Toronto 's Gay Village district. McArthur faces a potential sentence of life in prison with no chance for parole for 25 years or more.

A Canadian prosecutor asked a judge Tuesday to sentence serial killer Bruce McArthur to consecutive life sentences. McArthur pleaded guilty last week to eight counts of first-degree murder. The former landscaper sexually assaulted , killed and dismembered men he met in Toronto 's Gay Village district over seven years. The most lenient potential sentence he faces would be life in prison with no chance for parole eligibility for 25 years.

Canadian serial killer Bruce McArthur revealed details of his evil crimes. The 67-year-old posed his victims in fur coats and put cigars in their mouths. Police found the pictures of the men on a memory stick with a separate folder for each of his eight victims. McArthur is just the latest serial killer to hit the headlines.

Bruce McArthur should be serving consecutive periods of parole ineligibility for all of the eight murders he committed. Derek Saretzky and Douglas Garland each received such punishments for the triple murders they committed. Jason Klaus and Joshua Frank were spared such treatment for their triple homicides. While the motive for each may have been the same , the killer 's own gratification was different.

Bruce McArthur pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder in January. McArthur was first arrested last January when he was charged with the murder of two men. New alleged details indicate investigators found eight folders on his hard drive. Those folders contained photos of the men -- both alive and dead -- in macabre poses.

Friends and family of the murdered men shared memories of the lives that were cut short by unspeakable violence. The victims' victim impact statements were read aloud in a Toronto courtroom this week at the sentencing hearing for the Toronto landscaper-turned-serial killer. Skandaraj Navaratnam came to Canada to help provide a better life for his family back home in Sri Lanka. Abdulbasir Faizi was a married father of two daughters. Majeed Kayhan was a 58-year-old man who lived in the Church-Wellesley Village.

Lawmakers late February 8 voted 153-140 to ratify the NATO accession protocol for neighboring Macedonia that must now also be approved by all other alliance members. The vote came after the former Yugoslav republic agreed with Greece last year to change its name to North Macedonia. Greece 's objections to Skopje 's use of the name Macedonia since the country 's independence in 1991 complicated bids by the small Western Balkan state to join the EU and NATO.

Macedonia signed its accession protocol to NATO on February 6. Dr. Vankovska says the country is in an extremely difficult economic, political, inter-ethnic and military situation. She expects the country to soon face serious internal challenges precisely in the next couple of years.

North Macedonia's inclusion means NATO will soon have 30 members. That is double what NATO 's membership was in 1991. The addition is a setback for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Putin has for many years argued that NATO is no longer needed because Russia poses no threat.

Macedonia will become the 30th member of the U.S.-led alliance. A deal with Greece ended a 27-year-old dispute over its name. Russia says that by taking in Balkan members, the alliance is undermining security in the region. Western countries see NATO and E.U. membership as the best way of preserving peace.

Greece 's foreign ministry submitted to the parliament 's national defence and foreign affairs committee on Wednesday evening. Discussion in the committee will begin at 2:00 p.m. and will be completed in the parliament plenary on Friday with the vote. At NATO Headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday the permanent representatives to the alliance 's 29 members signed the accession protocol.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 's Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov on Wednesday signed an accession protocol. The signing ceremony marks the start of a ratification process that could take several months. Greece will be the first country whose MPs will be called upon to ratify the protocol with a vote expected in the House on Friday.

All 29 NATO countries and Macedonia signed the accession protocol in Brussels on Wednesday. Until June 2018, the name dispute had prevented Macedonia from pursuing membership in NATO and the European Union. Skopje and Athens agreed on a new name , the Republic of North Macedonia. The deal , however, resulted in mass rallies in both countries.

Macedonia signs accession papers with NATO on Wednesday. Key step on the way to joining the alliance after resolving a long-running name row with Greece. The agreement last month with Greece to change the name of the former Yugoslav republic to the Republic of North Macedonia ended one of the world 's longest diplomatic disputes.

NATO and North Macedonia signed an accession protocol on Wednesday. The former Yugoslav republic will officially join the military bloc. Each member will now need to ratify the bid, but it is safe to say that the country 's 10-year accession saga is now over.

Representative Eliot L. Engel and Representative Michael McCaul urge the US administration to support the membership of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM ) in the NATO security alliance. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made public Wednesday , the Foreign Affairs Committee leaders emphasized that the Balkan country 's NATO membership will help ensure stability and peace in the Balkans.

Newly named country celebrated the event with a flag-raising ceremony marking its prospective - and long-awaited - accession to Nato. Athens had blocked Skopje 's membership of the alliance arguing its northern neighbour 's use of the name without geographic qualification amounted to theft of its own history and cultural heritage. The strategic Balkan state will become Nato 's 30th member once ratified by other signatories.

Macedonia Joining NATO Is a Self-Inflicted Defeat for Russia ( Op-ed ) In the Macedonian settlement, Russia chose a tactic that was doomed to fail, writes Dostoyevsky. The episode shows that confronting the West has become an intrinsic value for Russia, he adds.

The Greek Parliament ratified the protocol permitting the accession to Nato of the newly renamed Republic of North Macdedonia as the 30th member of the Alliance. The vote put a definitive end to a nearly three decades-long dispute that thwarted Skopje 's Nato and EU accession process. The majority in the ratification vote was comprised of SYRIZA 's 145 MPs and eight more independents.

The United Nations confirmed on Wednesday that it has been officially informed by the Macedonian government that the country 's new name is North Macedonia. Since 1991, Athens had objected to its neighbor being called Macedonia because Greece has a historic northern province of the same name. The 27-year-old dispute was finally settled in June during UN-brokered talks.

Macedonia now is formally called the Republic of North Macedonia. The name change resolves a dispute with Greece dating back to 1991. Greece had long argued that its small neighbor 's name implied claims on the northern Greek province of Macedonia. A breakthrough in their name dispute came last summer when Macedonia and Greece agreed to a compromise.

Greece and Macedonia agreed on the new name last June and Athens lifted its 27-year veto on its tiny neighbour 's efforts to join NATO and the European Union. Greece had said use of the name Macedonia implied a territorial claim on a northern Greek province of the same name. Last week, Macedonia signed an accession protocol with NATO despite Russian criticism that further expansion by the alliance in the Balkans would undermine regional stability.

But by the time jurors began deliberations on Feb. 4, government prosecutors had put forth what they called an '' avalanche of evidence '' The trial methodically laid out the reality of how a massive criminal enterprise is run on a daily basis.

Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzmán Loera guilty of all 10 criminal counts against him. He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. The jury of eight women and four men deliberated roughly 34 hours over 6 days. The prosecution 's case featured 200 hours of testimony from 56 witnesses.

Anti-Semitic offences rose almost 10 percent in Germany last year. Violent attacks were up more than 60 percent, crime statistics showed Wednesday. A mass influx of mostly Muslim refugees and migrants to Germany from 2015 drove the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party.

Police recorded 1,646 offences motivated by hatred against Jews in Germany last year. Among these were 62 violent offences that left 43 people injured, up from 37 attacks the previous year. President of the Central Council of Jews inGermany said the statistics reflected a frightening trend. Germany has watched with alarm as anti-Semitic and other racist hate speech and violence have increased in recent years.

Two suspected former secret service officers from the Syrian regime have been arrested in Germany. They are accused of carrying out or aiding torture and crimes against humanity.

Another Syrian believed to have worked for the secret service was arrested in France on Tuesday. Both left Syria in 2012. The conflict in Syria has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions.

German prosecutors say the suspect, a man identified as Anwar R. , and one other Syrian citizen had been arrested on suspicion of crimes including torture of prisoners during their work for Syria 's intelligence service. A third arrest was made in France. The investigation was supported by the Commission for International Justice and Accountability ( CIJA ) , a team funded by the United States and several European governments.

The number of anti-Semitic crimes increased from 1,504 in 2017 to 1,646 in 2018. The number of cases considered violent increased from 37 to 62 over the same period up more than 60 percent.

But the three leaders will also discuss projects and coordination on the international arena. The summit is the fourth of its kind since Putin, Rouhani and Erdogan first met in Sochi in 2017.

The Syrian crisis entered a new phase following Turkish intervention. Turkey has been negotiating the future of the Syrian crisis with both the U.S. and Russia. As the only country providing support to mainstream opposition forces, Turkey has succeeded in keeping the opposition in the game. The positions of the main actors on the ground are quite complex. The four main actors have reached a deadlock since none have been able to come to an agreement.

Ankara and Moscow are closely monitoring the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham 's ( HTS ) attempts to enlarge its sphere of control in Syria 's Idlib.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson rules that Paulafort breached his plea deal with Robert Mueller. She rules that he lied to the FBI, Mr Mueller 's office and a grand jury. The verdict means that he could now potentially face harsher sentences or have charges against him re-filed. Last August, he was convicted of financial fraud relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson was another loss for the former Trump campaign chairman. He faces years in prison in two separate criminal cases stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation. The judge said he lied to Mueller about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik , his co-defendant who the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence. The ruling on Wednesday hurts his chance of receiving a reduced sentence.

More Americans say they trust Robert Mueller's version of the facts than President Trump's. More believe Mueller is mainly interested in finding out the truth than trying to hurt Trump politically. Strong majorities of Democrats and Republicans say Mueller 's report should be made public in its entirety. Poll indicates views could shift once the report is released.

A transcript of a closed-door hearing in the ongoing Paulafort case was released last week. Peter Bergen says it shows that prosecutors believe he lied to augment his chances of a pardon from President Trump. He says the hearing also revealed that prosecutors said he continued working with a longtime Ukrainian Russian business colleague on a Moscow-friendly initiative. Bergen: This bizarre move paralleled other curious contacts between the Trump crew and Russians following the 2016 election.

Manafort met with a Russian political operative at a New York cigar club in August 2016. The meeting was at the Grand Havana Club, a mahogany wood-paneled room with floor-to-ceiling windows offering panaromic views of the city. One subject the men discussed was a proposed resolution to the conflict over Ukraine, according to a partially redacted transcript of a Feb. 4 hearing.

Senate has uncovered no direct evidence of conspiracy between Trump campaign and Russia. After two years and 200 interviews, the Senate Intelligence Committee is approaching the end of its investigation into the 2016 election. But investigators disagree along party lines when it comes to the implications of a pattern of contacts they have documented betweenTrump associates and Russians.

56 % of respondents trust Mueller, compared to 33 % who have more confidence in Trump. Over the course of his investigation, Mueller has charged 34 people, including individuals from Trump 's inner circle and has found evidence that 25 Russians sought to influence the 2016 presidential election. Despite his findings thus far, those surveyed were split as to whether Mueller had proved coordination between Trump and Russia.

The transcript from a sealed hearing provides further insight into what special counsel Robert Mueller considers significant. It makes clear that prosecutors have homed in on the repeated contacts between Paulafort and his longtime associate. Still, it 's unclear what specifically has piqued prosecutors ' interests and whether it is connected to any election interference conspiracy.

After two years and 200 interviews, the Senate Intelligence Committee is approaching the end of its investigation into the 2016 election. Investigators disagree along party lines when it comes to the implications of a pattern of contacts they have documented between Trump associates and Russians. The final Senate report may not reach a conclusion on whether the contacts added up to collusion or coordination with Russia, Burr said.

Dowd said on the podcast that Trump each day reviews a staggering amount of information and is dealing with international issues whose signficance dwarfs the importance of the Mueller probe. Dowd said that Trump and the rest of the president 's legal team ended up following his advice by having the president answer questions from Mueller in writing, as opposed to in person.



NASA trying one last time to contact its record-setting Mars rover Opportunity. Opportunity has been silent for eight months, victim of one of the most intense dust storms in decades. NASA said Tuesday it will issue a final series of recovery commands. If there 's no response by Wednesday - which NASA suspects will be the case - Opportunity will be declared dead.

The six-wheeled vehicle helped gather critical evidence that ancient Mars might have been hospitable to life. Flight controllers tried numerous times to make contact and sent one final series of recovery commands Tuesday night. There was no response from space , only silence. The golf cart-size Opportunity outlived its twin, the Spirit rover, by several years.

NASA 's Mars rover pronounced dead 15 years after it landed on the red planet. Six-wheeled vehicle helped gather critical evidence that ancient Mars might have been hospitable to life. Opportunity roamed a record 28 miles around Mars and worked longer than any other lander - anywhere - ever.

US space agency NASA will make one final attempt to contact its Opportunity Rover on Mars late Tuesday. Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 and covered 28 miles ( 45 kilometers ) on the planet. A giant dust storm last year blocked sunlight from Mars , stopping Opportunity 's solar-powered batteries from being able to recharge.

NASA spent months trying to contact the Opportunity rover on Mars ever since it went silent in June 2018 beneath the weight of an epic , solar panel-smothering dust storm. Scientists and space fans are awaiting the final word on Oppy from NASA today, but they 're already coming together to mourn the valiant rover online.

T-Mobile and Sprint say American consumers would get more and pay less as a result of the merger. They argue that the combination would allow them to better compete - not only with Verizon and AT & T , but also with Comcast and others as the wireless , broadband and video industries converge.

NASA is convening its leadership to deliver what appears to be a eulogy for its well-traveled robot Wednesday at 11 a.m. PT. The bot had roamed the Red Planet since 2004 , but NASA lost contact with Opportunity during a planet-wide dust storm last June. Because the rover is solar-powered , it was unable to charge its batteries and operate.

Ex-Chicago police officer who killed Laquan McDonald attacked in prison , wife says. Jason Van Dyke was kept in isolation in Illinois after being convicted in the black teenager 's murder. But he was unexpectedly moved to a federal facility in Connecticut last week, she says.

Prosecutors ask Illinois ' highest court to review Jason Van Dyke's prison sentence. The white Chicago police officer was convicted in the shooting death of black teenager Laquan McDonald. The sentence was the first imposed on a Chicago officer for an on-duty shooting in a half century. Prosecutors say they believe Cook County Judge Vincent Gaughan improperly applied the law.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the special prosecutor who won a murder conviction against former officer Jason Van Dyke said they believe Cook County Judge Vincent Gaughan improperly applied the law last month. The filing sets in motion a legal battle that could ultimately result in the court forcing the judge to impose a longer sentence. The central issue in the petition is an Illinois law that allows a judge to sentence a person for only the most serious crime.

Jason Van Dyke Lead Prosecutor Joe McMahon joins John Williams to explain the petition on the counts for which he was sentenced. Chicago Tribune Reporter Stacy St. Clair tells John how she thinks the judge molded the sentence to fit the injury , not the murder of Laquan McDonald.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is challenging the sentencing of former Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke. van Dyke was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison for fatally shooting Laquan Mcdonald in 2014. He was convicted last October of Second-Degree Murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and a prosecutor on Monday challenged the sentence of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke for the murder of a black teenager.

They questioned whether the judge who imposed it followed the law due to his failure to account for other convictions. Van Yke was sentenced last month to nearly seven years in prison for second-degree murder in the shooting death of Laquan McDonald.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is pushing for a tougher prison sentence for Jason Van Dyke. Raoul and the special prosecutor are asking the Illinois Supreme Court to order a new sentencing hearing. They argue Gaughn should have sentenced Van Yke on 16 counts of aggravated battery, not just on the second degree murder conviction.

Special prosecutors and the Illinois attorney general 's office want the state 's highest court to order a resentencing for Jason Van Dyke. If granted, the move could result in a much harsher prison term for the former Chicago police officer convicted in the slaying of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Their petition does not explicitly target the length of the 6 3/4-year sentence , which many activists criticized as lenient.

Illinois ' top prosecutor is challenging Jason Van Dyke 's prison sentence after the former Chicago police officer was found guilty in the 2014 murder of teenager Laquan McDonald.

Raoul said he formally filed a mandamus petition asking the state Supreme Court to review the case and order Van Yke to be resentenced.



The women and children who escaped the eastern Syrian town of Baghuz on Tuesday were not supposed to be there. Weeks of bombing and an exodus had largely accounted for the pre-war population of 9,000. After three days of intensive bombardment, more people emerged than the attackers had thought possible. They included women from France , Russia and Tajikistan as well as families from Iraq and nearby Syrian towns and cities.

Western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces are expected to announce the territorial defeat of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( Isil ) in the coming days. Some 2,000 US special forces supporting the Kurdish-led forces will be brought home by April. Washington has not outlined any plans to support SDF efforts to combat Isil after their exit.

A new U.N. report to the Security Council shows that ISIL/Da'esh is still a global threat. The threat posed by returning and relocating fighters, as well as from individuals inspired by them, remains high and has a global reach. The document was prepared on behalf of the UN Secretary-General by the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate.

Dura Ahmed, 28, from Toronto, said her husband persuaded her to travel to Syria.

Abu Jaber al-Shaiti has waited for more than four years for his revenge. His kin in the Shaitat tribe stood up to challenge the group 's designs on their oil-rich lands. ISIL hunted down 700 to 1,000 men, shot some and beheaded others. Abu Jaber joined the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces because he wanted to help wipe out ISIL.

A new U.N. report to the Security Council shows that ISIL/Da'esh is still a global threat, despite the decline in the number of attacks worldwide during 2018. The report notes that the centre of gravity of the organization remains in Iraq and Syria, with up to 18,000 remaining in the ranks. The UN analysis shows that Member States continue to face tremendous challenges across the world in tackling the threats posed by ISIL.

Shamima Begum, 19, vanished from her home in Bethnal Green in London four years ago. She was found in a refugee camp in Syria as the Isil caliphate collapsed. In an interview with the Times she described how she had been living in the caliphate and had married an Isil fighter from the Netherlands.

Shamima Begum is one of three schoolgirls who left the UK to live in ISIL 's so-called caliphate in Syria. She is now nine months pregnant and fears for her unborn child after two of her other children died. Begum was married to Dutch fighter Yago Riedijk, 12 years her senior, while her two friends also married foreign ISIL fighters.

Amazon is ditching its plans to build a new headquarters in New York after facing backlash from members of the community. Amazon selected New York City and Northern Virginia in November to split duty as its second headquarters. Critics blasted the $ 1.525 billion in incentives New York offered to lure the tech behemoth.

Alderman Ameya Pawar said he plans to introduce legislation that would reduce incentives awarded to companies that automate promised jobs.

By 56 percent to 36 percent, New Yorkers approved of the agreement between New York and the online retail giant.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has had a very good month, says Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: But the deal to build half of Amazon 's second headquarters in New York City hit a roadblock.

Brazilian police arrest eight employees of mining giant Vale SA on suspicion of murder. A judge found evidence suggesting they had known for months about significant safety problems at one of its dams. The dam 's auditors considered falsifying results of a safety inspection out of fear that Vale would cancel another contract.

A letter signed by more than 15 NGOs said that Vale failed to take proper safety measures. The call for Vale to be expelled from the United Nations Global Compact is a symbolic step. Vale declined to immediately comment, but has previously said the dam had all necessary safety certificates.

Vale's CFO Luciano Siani was asked about management 's knowledge of the internal documents. The report classified the dam at Brumadinho as being two times more likely to fail than the maximum level of risk tolerated under internal guidelines. Mr Siani said there was a lot of controversy about this recommendation to pass technical details to senior management.

The death toll from Brazil 's tragic dam disaster in southeast Minas Gerais state has climbed to 166. The state civil defence agency said , 155 people are still missing since the tailings dam collapsed on January 25. The agency official said that efforts to locate the bodies of the missing continue though rescuers are finding increasingly fewer bodies.

Brazilian miner Vale 's safety procedures have not worked, CEO says. CEO Fabio Schvartsman was responding to questions from lawmakers. One of the company 's dams collapsed last month with the loss of hundreds of lives. The company is still dealing with the consequences of the 2015 collapse of a nearby dam.

Vale is facing several investigations over the Jan. 25 disaster in the town of Brumadinho in Minas Gerais state. The break of Vale 's dam polluted the Paraopeba river and killed at least 166 people. Vale prioritized profit over the safety of its workers at the dam, a prosecutor says.

The Netherlands says it will set up a humanitarian aid hub for crisis-torn Venezuela on its Caribbean island of Curacao.

Venezuela 's opposition-controlled congress named new temporary boards of directors to state-oil firm PDVSA on Wednesday. Controlling PDV SA 's U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum would go some way to helping in that , though seizing the reins of PDVsa itself seems improbable while Maduro remains in power. The nominations fuel a growing duel for control between Guaido and Maduro, who has promised he will not allow Citgo to be stolen.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld said he 's launching a presidential exploratory committee to run in 2020 as a Republican. Weld is the first potential primary challenger to the President . to take down Trump. History shows that presidents generally only face serious primary challenges when their approval rating within their own party is at 75 % or below. Trump is currently far above this threshold .

The 59th quadrennial United States Presidential election is scheduled to be held on November 3, 2020. Senator Amy Jean Klobuchar and Senator Sherrod Campbell Brown have already begun exploring a run for the world 's most powerful office. A record total of five women have so far entered the race for the presidency - these also include Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Tulsi Gabbard and Kirsten Gillibrand.

Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld has changed his party registration from Libertarian back to Republican. If he enters the race - and does so in his old party - he will be the first rebel Republican to challenge Trump. With the party firmly under Trump 's control , the GOP is now working to stifle any potential rebellion.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld could begin a bid for the White House Friday in New Hampshire. If he does declare his candidacy or announce the formation of an exploratory committee, Weld would become the first Republican to announce a primary challenge to Trump. The odds against ousting an incumbent president are long, and Weld comes with a history of failed political campaigns.

Former Massachusetts Gov . William Weld is expected to discuss his status as a possible candidate for president this week. Weld recently changed his party registration from Libertarian back to Republican. Weld served as a Republican governor from 1991 until 1997. He later became a Libertarian and ran for vice president on a ticket with former New Mexico Gov . Gary Johnson in 2016.

Former Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld is launching a presidential exploratory committee to challenge President Trump in the Republican primaries.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced its intention to sue less than an hour after the White House released the text of Mr. Trump 's declaration. Public Citizen later filed suit, urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to bar Trump and the Department of Defense from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several Democratic state attorneys general already have said they might go to court.

President Trump is set to sign a spending bill that keeps the government open. He is also set to lay out his plans to divert billions of dollars of funds to build a wall on the southern U.S. border. The moves stave off a second government shutdown but have ignited a new battle over his border-spending ambitions.

Declaration prompts dire warnings but fallout could be contained by successful legal challenge or resolution in Congress. State attorneys general across the country threaten to sue the White House over Donald Trump 's declaration of a national immigration emergency on Friday.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the search giant is investing more than $ 13 billion this year in data centers and office facilities. The company also hired more than 10,000 people in the U.S. in 2018. Google 's investments have been met with little of the blowback that Amazon has faced since announcing its plan to expand in New York City three months ago.

A school board in Louisiana voted in January against giving the oil giant Exxon a nearly $ 3 million property tax break. In Virginia, Democratic state House Del. Lee Carter is raging against a $ 70 million incentive package to chip maker Micron.

The hope of landing Amazon 's second North American headquarters - and the promise of thousands of new jobs - is back in focus. Amazon announced in November it would split the HQ2 project between New York and Arlington , Virginia.

Google plans more than $ 13 billion in investments this year in data centers and offices across the US. CEO Sundar Pichai says major expansions in 14 states are planned. Google needs to bulk up as it builds its cloud business and looks to catch up with frontrunners Amazon Web Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it 's '' mission critical '' to complete the HQ2 deal with the e-tailer. However, there 's no guarantee New Yorkers would be hired to fill a majority of the Amazon positions. Also, half of the 25,000 jobs are not expected to be tech related.

President Trump says he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border. He is tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall. The move is expected to face a swift and forceful legal challenge that could stall the attempt in the courts. But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to fight for border wall construction.

Trump announced last week he would hold a second summit with Kim in Hanoi on Feb. 27 and 28. North Korea has been seeking a lifting of punishing U.S.-led sanctions.

The Singapore summit in June represented the first time a sitting U.S. president met with a North Korean leader.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was sending his team back to Asia in the coming days for further discussions around all issues discussed at a groundbreaking Singapore summit last June. Trump announced last week he would hold a second summit with Kim in Hanoi on Feb. 27 and 28. The United States has been demanding that North Korea give up a nuclear weapons programme.

South Korea endured more political turbulence than almost any other country in 2018. Few South Koreans had expected that US President Donald Trump would show such determination in undermining the post-war liberal international order.

Kim Jong-un has gained much more than Donald Trump from the process, writes Peter Bergen. Bergen: Kim has exploited the trademark Trump ego, which takes narcissism to unusual heights even for a head of state. Any abrupt Trumpian change of mind will thus to reckon with considerable opposition from Seoul and China.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says U.S.-North Korea summit to be held in Hanoi on Feb. 27 and 28.

Millions of Nigerians are about casting their votes to elect the President that will be our national leader beginning from May 29th 2019 for four years tenure. Should the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari wins fairly , he will only spend 4 years and no more since he has already had the first four years. If the leading opposition politician and erstwhile Vice President Atiku Abubakar should coast home to victory , he may choose to exercise his constitutional right to seek for a final second four year term except he bows to pressure and allow much younger candidate to take the shot in 2023.

Suspected Boko Haram rebels have attacked the convoy of the governor of Nigeria 's Borno state and killed at least three people. Governor Kashim Shettima 's convoy came under attack while travelling from state capital Maiduguri to Gamboru Ngala for a campaign rally. The region is a hotbed of Boko Haram and has witnessed increased attacks on military bases.

Fleeing residents say Boko Haram fighters are patrolling the main road between two towns. The Islamic extremists have seized several towns in a 200-mile arc running alongside northeast Nigeria 's border with Cameroon. The United States said it is launching a major border security program for Nigeria and its neighbors.

Mike Kanu is a middle aged trader in Maiduguri , Borno State. He was kidnapped by Boko Haram insurgents in October, 2015. He claimed to have escaped from the Boko Haram dungeon in 2016. Kanu lamented that since that incident, he had been uprooted from his legitimate trading business.

Nigeria is Africa 's most populous country , and its most violence-stricken. More civilians were killed in targeted attacks in Nigeria last year than in either Yemen or Afghanistan. Nigeria 's population is rapidly growing and is expected to overtake the United States ' by 2050.

Nigerians will vote for a president on 16 February. Much is anticipated regarding the new leader 's strategy to end the deadly Boko Haram insurgency.

Egypt 's army says seven suspected jihadists were eliminated and 15 soldiers killed or wounded in an attack in the Sinai Peninsula.

The talks between the U.S. and the Taliban that are being planned for this month in Qatar and possibly Pakistan would be the best one possible under the circumstances. But peace is entirely contingent upon the Americans faithfully standing by the current government of Afghanistan. There will be no true , lasting peace if the Americans simply use these negotiations as a cover for a hasty retreat and leave the door open for the Taliban to take over.

Militant group says meeting on Feb. 18 is being conducted at 'formal invitation ' of Government of Pakistan. The Taliban also announced a meeting with Prime Minister Khan in Islamabad for comprehensive discussions about bilateral affairs with Afghanistan. News reports in Pakistan last month had suggested Islamabad was open to hosting the next round of talks with the insurgents.

Afghanistan's future is so difficult to anticipate because of internal and external variables. Peace talks between the US and the Taliban are underway, with a parallel Moscow process also ongoing. Pakistan is unable to take full advantage of a situation that it once deemed desirable. Romantic notions of India recreating old alliances are no longer particularly realistic.

US-Taleban negotiations in Doha address how to end the Afghan war. First progress has been made in the form of an agreed draft framework.

There are disturbing signs that Democrats ' answer to the tumult in this country is inaction, writes Julian Zelizer. Zelizer: The Trump administration faces a test in Venezuela.

Seven MPs resign from the Labour Party in protest over anti-Semitism and Brexit. They are Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey. They will sit in Parliament as the Independent Group but are not launching a new party. Labour 's deputy leader Tom Watson urges the hard left to stop celebrating the departure.

A majority of voters believe the Labour leader has been dishonest and ineffective in his handling of the problem. Only a tiny proportion believe the Islington North MP has been very competent in handling the issue. Of voters who acknowledge Labour has an anti-semitism problem, almost a third say it will make them much less likely to vote for the party.

Former Labour vice chairman Michael Dugher has said he is intending to leave the party. Mr Dugher said he now regards it as 'institutionally anti-Semitic' He served as vice chairman of the party under Ed Miliband between 2011 and 2014. Labour disclosed this week it had received 673 allegations of anti-Semitism by its members over the past 10 months.

Mr Dugher served as vice chairman of the party under Ed Miliband between 2011 and 2014 and later became shadow secretary for transport and culture. Labour disclosed this week it had received 673 allegations of anti-Semitism by its members over the past 10 months, leading to 12 individuals being expelled. A party spokesman said the numbers involved amounted to around 0.1 % of the total membership roll.

Former Labour vice chairman vows to quit the party over anti-Semitism. Mr Dugher claims the party he signed up to nearly three decades ago 'no longer exists' He said situations where prominent Jewish Labour MPs needed police protection 'made him want to cry ' He also spoke of his fears over the 'attitude ' of shadow chancellor John McDonnell after Ms Berger was facing a vote of no confidence from her local party.

Shadow chancellor says no need for split on Brexit as party may still back people 's vote. McDonnell warned Labour MPs on the verge of quitting they could cause a decade of Thatcherite Tory rule. He said there was no need to split as the party was holding together on all of the key issues.

Shadow Chancellor said those who stand against Labour MPs would split the vote like those who joined the SDP did in the 1980s. Mr McDonnell appealed to MPs considering quitting telling them there was no need to do so over Brexit. Margaret Beckett has also warned MPs off a split saying it would be a 'mistake'

Shadow Chancellor says Labour must be 'ruthless' in stamping out anti-Semitism. Admits the party has not been 'fast enough' in dealing with the ongoing problem. Comes as former MP Michael Dugher says he's leaving the party over the issue. And there are reports that Jewish MP Luciana Berger may also go.

A rare species of giant tortoise was feared extinct after over 100 years without any sightings on the Galápagos Islands. But now, officials say they 've found one. An adult female Fernandina Giant Tortoise , or Chelonoidis phantasticus , possibly older than 100, was found on Fernandina Island. The species is unique to Fernandina, one of the more than a dozen islands in the famous archipelago.

The Bramble Cay melomys was declared extinct this week by researchers in Australia. This rodent is reportedly the first mammal species wiped out by human-induced climate change. The entire species lived on one 10-acre island in the South Pacific. The main reason for the species ' downfall was almost certainly ocean flooding in the past decade.

A giant tortoise believed extinct for over 100 years has been discovered on the Galapagos island of Fernandina, Ecuador 's environment minister says. An adult female specimen of the Chelonoidis Phantasticus species was found by an expedition, Marcelo Mata wrote in a tweet reposted by the two organisations. An assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) published in 2017 listed the species as "critically Endangered"

Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston quit the Conservatives to join a new independent group. They said Theresa May had allowed their former party to fall prey to hardline Brexiters. The dramatic resignations sent shockwaves through Westminster, where MPs had barely digested news of the Labour split. The move reduces May 's already tenuous working majority to eight, raising more questions over her authority.

PM Theresa May writes to 317 Tory MPs urging to unite behind a Brexit deal. Efforts will resume this Monday to persuade the EU to agree changes to the backstop plan. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright has hinted MPs ' concerns could be addressed without reopening the deal. Labour says the Tories can not be united and has called for cross-party talks.

Tories held hostage by ERG while Labour splitters go it alone - does anyone still believe in consensus ? Welcome to the Guardian 's weekly Brexit briefing, striving to make sense of the nonsensical since summer 2016. On and on and on it goes … Theresa May appealed ( again ) to the Commons for more time to seek substantive changes to the Northern Ireland backstop.

A Conservative minister and four backbenchers appear poised to defect to the new Independent Group set up by Labour MPs, it has been claimed. Describing the breakaway group as ' remarkably sensible people', the minister said he was prepared to join the new party if the Government presses ahead with a no-deal Brexit.

British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will on Tuesday urge the government to adopt his party 's plan for a permanent customs union with the EU.

Venezuela 's President Nicolás Maduro has closed the border with Brazil amid a row over humanitarian aid. He said he could also shut the key border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in relief. President Maduro denies any crisis and calls aid delivery plans a US-orchestrated show. His ally Russia has accused the US of trying to arm Venezuela 's opposition. Rival concerts will be held on both sides of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó said he is confident humanitarian aid will get to the people of Venezuela. The opposition is planning to deliver stockpiles of U.S. aid along the Colombian-V Venezuelaan border this weekend in defiance of embattled president Nicolás Maduro. The Venezuelan people are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis as Maduro has reportedly blocked aid from entering.

Venezuela 's military reaffirmed its support for embattled President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said they were on alert for border violations. The military high command has so far maintained its public backing for Maduro -- seen as key to keeping him in power. Opposition leader Juan Guaido is appealing to military leaders to switch allegiance to him.

Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said that the military countries remain close to its president , Nicolas Maduro. The Venezuelan military will defend the borders of the Bolivarian Republic, he said. The statement of the head of the military department was made a day after the words of US President Donald Trump where he claimed he was considering all options relating to a transferring power in Venezuela.

Brazil will put humanitarian aid on Venezuelan border on 23th February at request of opposition leader Guaido. President Nicolas Maduro 's government had earlier refused to take in the aid, stressing it could justify foreign interference in the country 's domestic affairs. The aid includes food products and medicines that will be available in the Brazilian cities of Boa Vista and Pacaraima.

Japan recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country 's legitimate president on Tuesday. The move adds to the growing international pressure on the regime of dictator Nicolás Maduro from over 50 countries around the world.

British billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist Richard Branson is spearheading a unique and historic concert on the Venezuelan-Colombian border. The concert will gather more than a dozen international artists in an area near the Tienditas international bridge. The bridge is the main land crossing point between the two countries , and is located just east of the city of Cucuta.

Juan Guaidó is asking followers to surround military bases on Saturday to demand that the armed forces allow aid into the country. The provocative move is likely to inflame Nicolás Maduro. Maduro says the aid push is illegal and tantamount to an invasion. Venezuela has been mired in a political stalemate since Jan. 23.

President Trump spoke at the International University Ocean Bank Convocation Center in Miami on February 18. His speech came at a time when opponents of Venezuela 's President Nicolás Maduro are attempting to remove the Marxist strongman from the presidency. On January 23, the president issued a statement of support for Juan Guaidó , the president of the country's National Assembly.



A fossil found in Utah is helping paleontologists better understand how North America 's tyrannosaurs went from ecological paupers to princes. Weighing about 170 pounds and standing less than five feet tall, Moros intrepidus is one of the smallest dinosaurs of its kind dating back to the Cretaceous period. The find suggests that the ancestors of Moros crossed a land bridge from Asia into North America.

Utah State freshman Sidnee Lavatai has been named the Mountain West Women 's Tennis Player of the Week for matches played through Tuesday , Feb. 19. LavataI posted a combined 4-0 record last weekend as Utah State went 1-1 with a 5-2 home win against Grand Canyon and a 4-3 home loss to Idaho. Utah State is back in action this week as they will travel to El Paso , Texas for two matches.

Moros intrepidus is the oldest Cretaceous tyrannosaur species yet discovered in North America. The bones of Moros also revealed the origin of T. rex 's lineage on the North American continent. When the scientists placed Moros within the family tree of tyrannosaurs they discovered that its closest relatives were from Asia.

Moros intrepidus lived 97 million years ago during the late Cretaceous period. Analysis found it weighed only 180 pounds ( 78 kg ) and was barely four foot tall at the hip - roughly the size of the modern mule deer. It is an ancestor of the T-Rex which evolved 14 million years later. Unlike the ferocious reputation of its descendent , the dinosaur was not at the top of the pecking order and had to contend with the allosaurs - the apex predator of the time. Researchers claim tyrannosauroids stayed small in stature for about 15 million years , before becoming behemoths like T- Rex over 16 million years.

The Moros intrepidus was discovered in Utah. It would have grown to 1.2 m ( 3.9 ft ) tall at the hip and weighed 78 kg ( 172 lb) That makes it an absolute featherweight compared to its great-great grandkids like T-Rex, which routinely stood 3.6 m ( 12 ft ) and topped out at 8 tons.

The Moros intrepidus roamed the plains of modern-day Utah around 96 million years ago. It is the earliest member of the Tyrannosaur family yet identified on the North American continent. Scientists believe the new dinosaur offers clues as to how its more famous cousin reached its epic size.

The Moros intrepidus , standing just 3 feet high at the hip and weighing as much as an adult human , roamed the plains of modern-day Utah around 96 million years ago. The team behind the discovery believes the new dinosaur offers clues as to how its more famous cousin reached its epic size.

The tiny cousin of T-rex could provide a key missing link in understanding how apex predators evolved to top the food chain, scientists say. The specimen would have weighed a shade less than 80 kilogrammes ( 175 pounds), making it extremely nimble.



France and Britain are the only other countries with troops on the ground in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State. They have provided training, supplies, logistics and intelligence for the Kurdish-dominated group that has done most of the fighting. Their concerns coincide with the administration 's failure, so far, to reach an agreement with Turkey not to attack the SDF.

France is set to move a proposal at the United Nations to include Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar in the global terrorist list. The Pakistan-based militant outfit had claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pulwama district. In 2017, the United States supported by the United Kingdom and France, had moved a proposal to ban Azhar at the UN Sanctions Committee 1267. The proposal was blocked by China, which is a permanent member of the UN and holds veto power in the UN Security Council.

U.S. nurtured a plan to split off a part of Syrian territory on the eastern bank of the Euphrates and create a puppet quasi state there, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday. The United States openly declares that after withdrawing from Syria , it will support the Kurds , but only if they do not cooperate with the Syrian government and Russia, Lavrov said.

This will be the second time that France will put forth its proposal at the United Nations. India 's attempts to list Azhar at the UN Security Council have been repeatedly blocked by China. JeM had claimed responsibility for the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives.

The United Nations is not involved in any discussions about the organization potentially having an observational role on Syria 's northeastern border. A UN official from the relevant department told Sputnik that any deployment of such a force under UN auspices would require a mandate from the Security Council. In a televised address on Sunday, Syrian President Bashar Assad warned the Kurds that only the Syrian state would be able to protect them.

Pentagon did not confirm an Iraqi official 's statement that the United States will withdraw its forces from Syria through Iraqi territory by April 1. The US troops have been operating in Syria as part of an international coalition for about five years without the permission of Syrian authorities or the UN Security Council.

French ambassador to India said that France will move a proposal in a couple of days to put Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar on the global terrorist list. In 2017, France supported by the United States and the United Kingdom, had moved a proposal at the UN to get Azhar declared a global terrorist , but it was blocked by China at the behest of Pakistan. The proposal, when moved, will be the fourth such bid at UN in past ten years.



Ex-army chief Benny Gantz and TV-host-turned politician Yair Lapid form alliance. Mr Gantz agreed to hold office as prime minister for first two-and-a-half years. Mr Lapid agreed to rotate as PM if they win Israeli elections on 9 April. PM Netanyahu forged alliance with several far-right parties to shore up votes.

Former IDF chiefs of staff Benny Gantz and Moshe Ya'alon unveiled their joint Israel-Resilience-Telem list. No potential partners like Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid, Gesher head Orly Levy-Abecassis or Haredi Womens College founder Adina Bar-Shalom attended. Sources in the parties said attempts to make new political mergers had regressed.

Israel Resilience party chief Benny Gantz was set Wednesday morning to meet fellow centrist leader Yair Lapid. Gantz is trying to reach a merger deal with Lapid 's Yesh Atid party. Polls have shown that a merger of both parties would become the biggest Knesset faction and have a better chance to challenge Netanyahu 's Likud.

Otzma Yehudit seems likely to get into the Knesset, thanks to PM Benjamin Netanyahu. Party's leaders are proud disciples of Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose party was banned in 1988 on grounds of racist incitement. Some of the party 's top candidates have spoken out against the merger.

Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz are both highly decorated former Israeli army officers. Gantz accuses Netanyahu of abandoning Israel when he was younger in favor of a more comfortable life in America. Netanyahu responds by saying Gantz is a joke and a sock puppet of his campaign advisors.

Ehud Barak is urging a merger between centrist parties Israel Resilience and Yesh Atid. Barak says reports the two parties are close to a unity pact mean party leaders Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid are coming to their senses at the last second.

Jewish Home leader Rafi Peretz says he backs a deal offered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The deal would see his party merge with an extremist faction, Otzma Yehudit. In exchange for 2 ministerial posts in the next government and the 28th slot on Likud party list.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Bayit Yehudi-National Union came to a far-reaching agreement on Wednesday in exchange for the latter adding representatives of Otzma Yehudit to their list. The agreement includes two cabinet seats for the list, as well as the 28th spot on the Likud 's list, to which Netanyahu is allowed to appoint someone. The sides also agreed not to attack each other during their election campaigns.

The PM is pressing the religious Zionist Jewish Home party to partner with the Kahanists of Otzma Yehudit. It makes cynical political sense for his interests , but what of Israel 's ? Netanyahu 's despicable push to bring racists into Israel's political mainstream.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly canceled a trip to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. Netanyahu and Putin are expected to speak on the phone on Thursday morning and a new date for a face-to-face meeting will be set. Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov was quoted as saying that the meeting was postponed due to internal Israeli political reasons.

The February 27-28 summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, will take place just over a week out from the Singapore summit.

A senior North Korean official arrived in Hanoi on Saturday to check the final details of the second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.

North Koreans are taking greater interest in the Nobel Peace Prize and leader Kim Jong Un. North Korean authorities have raised the possibility Kim could be awarded the peace prize. North Korea is also attacking a recent decision in Seoul to pay more for U.S. forces on the peninsula.

US officials negotiating with North Korea to rid the country of nuclear weapons do not know if Pyongyang intends to accept that goal, a senior administration official said on Thursday. The comments come amid preparations for a second summit meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, scheduled to take place next week in Hanoi. The first meeting, held in June in Singapore, ended with commitments to work toward normalisation of US-North Korea relations.

A senior Trump administration official said North Korean officials have so far given little away in their meetings with the top U.S. envoy.

Senior Democrats in the House and Senate have been sounding alarm bells. They warn that South Korean President Moon Jae-in is moving too fast in reconciling with North Korea. They are also expressing strong reservations about the US and South Korean negotiations with Kim. The congressional actions have been fueled by a steady stream of pessimistic and often misleading studies.

President Donald Trump has bragged about being the only person who can make progress with the denuclearization of North Korea. But his advisors worry he has other intentions-mainly , a peace deal between the Koreas. A cavalier attitude toward the question of denuclearized appears at odds with the objectives of other administration officials.

His main challenger, Atiku Abubakar , who represents the main opposition People 's Democratic Party ( PDP), voted in Yola. Early results revealed Abubakaar lost at his home polling station , with Buhar beating him with 186 votes to 167.

ATIKU ABUBAKAR: I grew up in a Nigeria where there was little crime. I want to give current generations of Nigerians a country that they will be proud of and pass onto future generations. I call on every Nigerian that means well for this country to join hands with PDP and me so that we can salvage this Country.

Prime Minister Theresa May says MPs will be able to have fresh vote by 12 March. She rules out holding another so-called "meaningful vote" this week. But she says talks with the EU are still ongoing and leaving on 29 March is within our grasp. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accuses the prime minister of running down the clock.

Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark say they would vote to extend Article 50. They say they will vote to give Britain more time to negotiate a deal with the EU. Article 50 is the clause which triggered the UK 's withdrawal from the EU - giving the country two years to negotiate an exit deal. The UK is due to leave on 29 March and Mrs May has insisted this will go ahead as planned.

Doctors, nurses and healthcare workers have written an open letter blasting the decision to exit the European Union. The letter says that they are losing their friends and the NHS is facing a nightmare after they were promised £350 million a week. They also claim a no-deal outcome would be worse.

The Irish government plans to fast-track the bill through Ireland 's parliament before the U.K. 's scheduled departure from the bloc on March 29.

Leaders of the 100-strong Brexit Delivery Group of moderate Conservatives made the threat in a letter to the chief whip. Andrew Percy said dozens of his colleagues would be prepared to vote for measures to delay the 29 March exit date if Mrs May 's deal is again rejected by MPs. Fresh Brexit talks have been scheduled for early next week as Mrs May heads towards another Commons showdown.

Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke told the Daily Mail newspaper that time is running out. It comes just days before parliamentarians will once again debate Brexit with May expected to table a motion for Wednesday. They are also expected to vote on a number of amendments, including one from Labour MP Yvette Cooper that seeks to extend Article 50.

Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke issue blunt warning to Tory Brexiteers. They say Parliament will prevent them forcing a disastrous no-deal break with the EU. Comments likely to be seen as a thinly veiled warning they could defy the Prime Minister Theresa May.

Labour MPs Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth are sounding the alarm as ministers prepare to unveil an emergency plan to unilaterally liberalise tariffs. The two Midlands politicians have also said they could withhold support for Theresa May 's Brexit deal unless the move is ruled out. HuffPost UK understands the prime minister could make an announcement on tariffs as early as Thursday.

Maurizio Sarri is clinging to his job after Chelsea 's humiliating 6-0 defeat at City. Chelsea have more wins at this stage of the season than City did in Guardiola 's first season at the Etihad Stadium in 2015/16. Guardiola had a history of success at Barcelona and Bayern Munich and was given time and funds to overhaul City. History suggests Sarri will not receive the same leeway.

Judge Gray H. Miller of Federal District Court in the Southern District of Texas took note of the Supreme Court 's 1981 ruling that the exclusion of women from the draft was fully justified. The Pentagon abolished those restrictions in 2015 , opening the way for women to serve in any military role for which they could qualify.

Ireland 's termination of pregnancy legislation came into effect on 1 January. Minister for Health Simon Harris said the government aims to have draft exclusion zone legislation prepared by this summer. The Pro-Life Campaign has consistently said that these zones are a legal non-starter and will be near-impossible to enforce.

The decision is the biggest legal challenge to the Selective Service System since the Supreme Court upheld the draft in 1981. In Rostker v. Goldberg , the court ruled that the male-only draft was fully justified because women were ineligible for combat roles. In 2015, the Pentagon lifted all restrictions for women in military service. The case was brought by the National Coalition of Men and two men who argued the all-male draft was unfair.

A federal judge has ruled that a men-only draft is unconstitutional. The Houston judge sided with a San Diego men 's advocacy group that challenged the government 's practice of having only men sign up for the draft. The government asked the judge to dismiss the suit or stay a decision until a national commission studying the issue of women 's draft registration reaches a recommendation.

A federal judge in Texas has declared the all-male military draft to be unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Gray Miller ruled that 'the time has passed ' for a debate on whether women belong in the military. Restrictions for women in military service were lifted by the Pentagon in 2015. The ruling could see and end to the Selective Service System which was upheld in the Supreme Court in 1981.

Under the Military Selective Service Act, only U.S. male citizens and men residing in the United States age 18 to 25 are legally required to register for potential military conscription. On Friday, a federal judge ruled the male-only draft unconstitutional. The Supreme Court opted to uphold the draft 's requirement in Rostker v. Goldberg in 1981.

David Ibbotson held a private pilot 's licence, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said. He could only fly passengers in the EU on a cost sharing basis, not for reward. Cardiff City said it had grave concerns over the validity of the pilot's licence. Sala's body was found in the wreckage of the Piper Malibu N264DB, which crashed on 21 January.

Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) will release its preliminary findings at around 2pm today. Emiliano Sala had only just signed for Cardiff City from French club Nantes for £15 million last month. The 28-year-old forward was being flown over the English Channel to make a start to his career in the Welsh capital when the tragedy struck.

David Ibbotson was also not allowed to take paying passengers because he only had a private licence - not a commercial one. He did n't have the qualifications to fly in bad weather but took their plane into a winter storm, it has also emerged. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB) will release its interim report into the accident at 2pm today. But ahead of that publication new documents from France have emerged about Mr IBBotson 's qualifications and pre-flight preparations. Images uploaded to social media by Fox Sports journalist Christian Martin appear to show that in his flight plan he made a number of 'basic errors'

Initial report into plane crash involving David Ibbotson and Emiliano Sala released today. Piper Malibu aircraft crashed in English Channel on January 21 with Sala as its only passenger. Sala's body was recovered after being found in the wreckage of the plane as part of a private search operation.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB) has released its interim report into the accident that disappeared off the coast of Guernsey on January 21. It has also emerged that the pilot David Ibbotson was also not allowed to take paying passengers because he only had a private licence - not a commercial one - and did n't have the qualifications to fly in bad weather. Images uploaded to social media by Argentine Fox Sports journalist Christian Martin appear to show that in his flight plan he made a number of 'basic errors ' before take-off. The pilot also reportedly used Visual Flight Rules ( VFR ) instead of Instrument Flight rules ( IFR ) in his pre-flight preparations.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) named regulatory requirements as one of four areas in which further work will be carried out. Emiliano Sala had just signed for Cardiff City from French club Nantes for £15 million when the plane crashed into the Channel on January 21.

Air Accidents Investigation Branch releases interim report into Emiliano Sala's death. Report shows previously unseen images of aircraft wreckage under water. Sala was flying to Cardiff from Nantes when plane he was flying on crashed into sea. His body was found earlier this month but body of pilot David Ibbotson is still missing. His family have raised £250,000 to fund a new search for his body.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) named regulatory requirements as one of four areas in which it will carry out further work. Its interim report noted that the type of licence held by pilot David Ibbotson meant he could only fly passengers in the European Union on a cost-sharing basis. Pilots with his licence must have a bona fide purpose for making the flight, according to the AAIB.

New photos of the plane wreckage which killed Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala have been published as part of an initial report into the tragedy. The document , compiled by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) , also found that further work is needed to probe the airworthiness, aircraft permissions and flight crew licencing around the flight.



International Court of Justice says UK should end control of Chagos Islands. Mauritius claims it was forced to give up the islands in 1965 in exchange for independence. UK Foreign Office says it will look carefully at the detail of the opinion. UK has previously said it will hand islands back to Mauritius when they are no longer required for defence purposes.

UN 's top court could help resolve a decades-long dispute over Britain 's eviction of the Chagos islanders to make way for a secretive military base on Diego Garcia. Judges at the International Court of Justice in the Hague will give their view at 3:00 pm ( 1400 GMT) over the legal battle between Britain and its former colony Mauritius over the fate of the Indian Ocean islands.

International Court of Justice judges will give their view at 3:00 pm ( 1400 GMT) Monday. Experts say that while this is an advisory opinion, it could nevertheless help resolve a political dispute that has lasted half a century. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the then colonial power Britain evicted around 2,000 Chagos islanders to make way for a secretive base on Diego Garcia.

Judges at the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in the Hague will give their view at 3pm ( 10pm, Singapore time ) over the legal battle between Britain and its former colony Mauritius over the fate of the Indian Ocean islands.

The Chagossians were expelled by the British government almost 50 years ago. The British government of Harold Wilson expelled the population of the Chagos Islands to make way for an American military base. The truth of this conspiracy did not emerge for another 20 years when secret official files were unearthed at the Public Record Office.

European Union official Donald Tusk has added pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May to delay the country 's departure from the bloc. Tusk said it would be a 'rational solution' to Britain's exit from the European Union. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March.

ICJ judges will rule on legal consequences of the seperation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965.

Mauritius argues that the Chagos archipelago was part of its territory since at least the 18th century. Britain insists it has sovereignty over the islands, which it calls the British Indian Ocean Territory. Britain evicted about 2,000 people from the islands so the U.S. military could build an air base on Diego Garcia.

Hezbollah is to be subject to a blanket ban under anti-terror laws, Sajid Javid has announced. The Lebanon-based group 's military wing is already outlawed but the proscription will now be extended to its political arm. If approved by Parliament, the step will bring Britain into line with several countries, including the US, which regard Hezbollah as a terrorist group.

Hezbollah has named a health minister and two other posts in Lebanon 's Cabinet. U.S. officials have called on Prime Minister Saad Hariri 's new government to ensure the group does not receive support from public resources. Ambassador Elizabeth Richard said Hezbollah continues to violate Lebanon's policy of non-involvement in regional conflicts.

Derby North MP Chris Williamson suspended pending investigation. Row erupted after footage showed him criticising Labour's handling of anti-Semitism. He said Labour had given too much ground in the face of criticism over the issue. Row comes just a week after nine Labour MPs quit the party over anti-Semitic issues.

Deputy leader Tom Watson has pledged to act as an extra safeguard. He has told colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party that his team plans to log and monitor all antisemitism complaints. Momentum chair and co-founder Jon Lansman has questioned the motivations of Skwawkbox, a website known to be well-briefed by the Labour leadership.

MP for Rossendale and Darwen Jake Berry was berated by Joseph Stevens of Rossendale Council. Stevens claimed the he was out of touch with his constituents and unable to understand local democracy. Berry had branded Rossendale Labour a 'Momentum-dominated hard-left ' group.

The government has caved in to pressure over the fate of EU citizens in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington told MPs the government supported him and would take his plan up with the EU. The decision follows a morning of chaos during which the Conservative MP who tabled the amendment was forced to quit his government post.

Amendment tabled on Tuesday by Tory backbencher Alberto Costa seeks to ringfence rights of all British nationals settled in the EU as well as EU citizens in the UK. It has been signed by Eurosceptics Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sir Edward Leigh, Steve Baker and Sir Graham Brady. May urged the 27 member states to match the UK 's guarantee it had made to EU citizens.

Alberto Costa is a Parliamentary Private Secretary ( PPS ) to Scottish Secretary David Mundell. He is calling for a separate agreement with the European Union to protect the rights of expats even if there is a no-deal Brexit. More than 60 Conservatives are understood to have signed an amendment which Labour is also supporting.

Sajid Javid blurts out that Government will BACK Tory MP Alberto Costa's bid. Mr Costa faced being sacked if Theresa May did not accept his amendment. It calls for joint UK-EU commitment to protect rights of expats even in No Deal. Yesterday the Prime Minister stopped short of giving her support. But today in confusing scenes the Home Secretary told MPs there was nothing wrong with it.

Alberto Costa has tabled an amendment to tonight 's non-binding votes in defiance of Government policy. The plan demands Britain fully implements the section of the divorce deal applying to citizens ' rights regardless of whether the deal is agreed by exit day. Mr Costa 's proposal appeared to have won Government support this morning as it was endorsed by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. But within hours Government sources confirmed he had been sacked. Mr Javid appeared unaware of Mrs May 's objection to the plan this morning.

Alberto Costa was born in Scotland to Italian parents. He was serving as a senior aide to Scottish Secretary David Mundell. Mr Costa had put down an amendment for a vote requiring the government to seek a separate agreement to guarantee EU citizens' rights. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said Mr Costa observed the convention that members of the government do not put down amendments.

Sajid Javid said the government would support the amendment laid by the Conservative MP Alberto Costa. But less than an hour after Javid made his comments, Costa left his post as parliamentary private secretary to the Scotland secretary , David Mundell. Sources close to Costa said he was given no option but to resign after tabling the amendment.

Sajid Javid said there was nothing wrong with Alberto Costa 's bid to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU and vice versa. But the SNP 's Stuart McDonald said the prime minster said on Tuesday she was opposed to this move. The home secretary appeared surprised when told the prime minister is not supporting a Brexit amendment.

Alberto Costa had tabled an amendment calling on the prime minister to strike a deal with Brussels. Home Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs on Wednesday morning that he had no problem with the amendment. But Theresa May on Tuesday indicated that the government would not be backing the plan.

Alberto Costa is understood to have quit his role as an aide to the Scotland Office. He had put forward an amendment in the House of Commons to protect EU citizens. Theresa May is now set to accept his amendment - in a humiliating climbdown. Yet Mr Costa is resigning his role anyway - because government aides are not allowed to table their own amendments.

Juan Guaido says he will exercise his duties as president as soon as he returns to Venezuela. Guaido met with US Vice President Mike Pence and Colombian President Ivan Duque this week. The meeting followed a weekend of violent clashes in Venezuela, where the military has blocked aid convoys. Duque says the way to deal with the Venezuela crisis is through diplomacy -- not war.

Russia has been a big investor in Venezuelan oil and gas. It has failed to save PdVSA from defaulting on all of its bond issues except the 2020 bond. Russia has sent private military contractors into Caracas to work as security for Maduro. Maduro is a Cuba loyalist having been indoctrinated into Castro anti-Americanism in the 1980s.

Juan Guaidó will go down in history as a person that broke all the rules of decency and democracy. If the U.S. attack on Venezuela takes place , every single victim will fall upon the conscience of Guaido and his protector : Donald Trump. Latin America and the people of the world are backing the Venezuelan people and their inalienable right to rule themselves.

Vice President Mike Pence arrived in the Colombian capital for an emergency summit of regional leaders. He immediately met with Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader the U.S. and 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela 's rightful president. Pence urged regional partners to freeze oil assets controlled by Maduro and transfer the proceeds to Guaidoó.

Jorge Ramos and his crew were detained at the Presidential Palace of Miraflores. Ramos said Maduro did not like the questions he was being asked and decided to abruptly stop the interview 17 minutes after it started. The news broke just as 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders refused to call Nicolas Maduro a dictator during a CNN town hall.

Vice President Mike Pence told Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó that President Trump supports him `` 100 percent . '' The Lima Group is a multilateral body established following the Lima Declaration on August 8, 2017 in Lima, Peru. Pence made clear that the U.S. government disputes Maduro 's position as the legitimate leader of Venezuela and recognizes Guaidoó's authority to carry out presidential functions.

Juan Guaidó will go down in history as a person that broke all the rules of decency and democracy. The President of Venezuela was elected by a sizable majority of the population in free, democratic elections. The aggressors are properly identified and their names will be inscribed in the world 's memory as what they are : traitors !

Vice President Mike Pence called on other countries to step up sanctions on Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. He announced an increase in U.S. economic pressure aimed at ousting the autocrat. Pence also said all options are on the table, a nod to the idea that America could use military force against the Maduro regime.

Venezuelan Supreme Court Justice Juan Carlos Valdez said on Tuesday that Guaido 's visit to Colombia on February 22 violated the travel ban imposed by the Venezuelan judiciary. State prosecutors are currently examining Guiadó 's conduct regarding possible crimes, the judge added. Guaidó told Colombian broadcaster NTN24 that he intends to return to Venezuela despite the risk of being arrested.

Venezuela blocks off second bridge to Colombia amid fresh skirmishes between protesters and security forces loyal to embattled leader Nicolás Maduro. The move came as opposition leader Juan Guaidó travelled to Brazil to shore up international pressure on Maduro following an inconclusive meeting of regional leaders in Colombia earlier this week.

President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met face-to-face Wednesday for the first time since their historic summit last year. The heads of the two nuclear-armed nations are squaring off in Vietnam for two days of talks that are set to focus on many of the same issues they debated last June in Singapore. Trump is pushing North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons as he dangles the prospect of an economic boost to the repressive isolated country. Kim wants to see sanctions eased without losing the strategic benefits of his weapons of mass destruction.

Trump and Kim may sign a political statement declaring an end to the 70-year-old Korean War. Such a declaration has been discussed in talks with North Korea for decades. The U.S. position previously has been that it would acknowledge and end the Korean War only after North Korea has completely given up its nuclear weapons program.

President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un held their first summit in 2018. Not much has changed since the first time the two met in 2017. The U.S. and North Korea have yet to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. The first summit took place in June in South Korea.

President Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un will meet this week. Peter Bergen says previous U.S. policy approaches did nothing to check North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Bergen: The only thing Kim and his regime really respect is hard power and President Trump 's assessed willingness to use it.

Dutch customs officials have intercepted about 90,000 bottles of Russian vodka which they claim was being smuggled to North Korea. Both the Customs Office and the Foreign Ministry of the Netherlands declined to elaborate on why they believe the vodka was being delivered to the country. The UNSC has repeatedly imposed sanctions on North Korea over the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

Kim Jong Un has grown in outward confidence as a negotiator since their last meeting, observers say. That could make it tougher to convince Mr. Kim to give up his nuclear weapons, they say. Mr. Trump and Kim will meet for a second summit this week in North Korea.

Uniformed soldiers lined a red carpet at the foot of the stairs from Air Force One to greet Trump as he descended. The President waved as he arrived and was presented a bouquet of flowers. He was greeted by several Vietnamese officials before walking down the carpet to his vehicle.

The United States and North Korea have yet to agree on what denuclearization entails. Washington wants the final, fully verifiable dismantlement of all of North Korea 's weapons of mass destruction. North Korea has indicated it will not give up its nuclear deterrent until the United States removes its troops from South Korea.

IAF says it foiled attempt by Pakistan to target military installations across the LoC. Pakistan says it lost a MiG-21 'Bison ' fighter and that one of the Indian pilots had gone missing while in action.

Netanyahu cut his trip to Russia short amid the growing reports of a looming indictment.

Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit is widely expected to announce as early as Thursday his decision on whether to press charges in three criminal investigations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However , he is likely to withhold case materials backing up any such decision until after elections on April 9, following a petition from Netanyahu 's defense team. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in all three probes. Netanyahu shortened his trip to Russia this week and canceled a planned event with Moscow 's Jewish community.

The Israeli prime minister reportedly shortened his visit to Russia and will return to Israel tonight because of the reports of an indictment.

Pakistan will release captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman on Friday. Prime Minister Imran Khan said it was a peace gesture. Indian officials said New Delhi will not negotiate any deal for the pilot 's release. India wants immediate, credible and verifiable action against terrorists.

Indian pilot shot down and captured by Pakistani forces this week will be released on Friday. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said as efforts to cool a crisis between the two nuclear-armed neighbours continued. "As a peace gesture we will be releasing him tomorrow," Khan told parliament in Islamabad on Thursday.

Imran Khan has called for a meeting of the National Command Authority ( NCA) in the aftermath of India 's pre-emptive , non-military air strikes at terror camps in Balakot in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The meeting will be attended by Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa as well as officials of the defence and foreign ministries.

Indian Air Force ( IAF ) fighter jets struck terror launch pads in Pakistan administered Kashmir on Tuesday. The IAF struck the biggest training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed ( JeM ) at Balakot in Pakistan just days after a suicide bomber killed 40 CRPF troopers in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has summoned a special meeting of the National Command Authority ( NCA) on Wednesday to discuss a response to India 's LoC violation. The prime minister is the chairperson of the NCA, which controls the country 's nuclear arsenal. The meeting will reportedly be attended by Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Zubair Mahmood Hayat and Army Chief General Qamar Javaid Bajwa.

cricket Gautam Gambhir retorted to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan 's statement that Pakistan will respond at the time and place of it 's choosing '' to Indian Air Force 's strikes on terrorist camps in Balakot. India retaliated after a Jaish terrorist attacked a truck carrying CRPF Jawans which killed more than 40 CRPF jawans in the process.

Pakistan strongly rejected India 's claim of targeting a terrorist camp in the country and causing heavy casualties. Pakistan vowed to respond at the time and place of its choosing and raise the issue at the UN and other international forums. Prime Minister Imran Khan asked the armed forces and the people of his country to remain prepared for all eventualities.

Pakistan Army claimed that it shot down two aircraft of Indian Air Force ( IAF ) and arrested their respective pilots. Indian media has rejected the claims made by Pakistan alleging that they were peddling fake news. Meanwhile, an emergency session of the National Command Authority , the highest security body in Pakistan , is underway in Islamabad and chaired by Pakistan 's Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Pakistan and Indian Air Forces had not engaged since the 1971 war. The unprecedented escalation had come within a fortnight of the Jaish-e Mohammad suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pulwama. India had shot down Imran Khan 's repeated offers for dialogue, arguing that talks and terror ca n't go hand in hand.

The intent was to show India, we can and would respond if aggression would be thrust upon us. We ensured no casualties and no collateral damage in the operations we undertook, says PM Imran Khan. The mission was a success, says the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The operation was conducted with the support of the Indian military.



YouTube says it will switch off comments on almost all videos featuring under-18s. The move is likely to include videos of toddlers uploaded by parents and short films by YouTube stars. A small number of YouTube content creators will be allowed to enable comments on videos featuring children. But they will be required to actively moderate their comments and demonstrate that their videos carry a low risk of attracting predatory comments.

The video prompts children to contact a fictional character named Momo by calling or texting strangers ' phone numbers. Momo then gives them dangerous challenges and sends horrifying messages. The challenges have been linked to two children 's deaths last year and are still available on YouTube and Instagram. Northern Ireland Police are liaising with other UK Police Services to identify the extent of the problem.

A concerned mum has shared the horrifying detail hidden in some kids ' YouTube videos - disturbing messages encouraging youngsters to consider suicide. Free Hess , a paediatrician and mum-of-one, spotted a chilling clip showing a man on the screen , giving directions on how to take your own life. The worrying part about it, was it had been sandwiched between a children 's video game on YouTube - meaning many busy parents may not have realised their kid would be exposed. The horror find and warning comes after fresh reports of the terrifying Momo Challenge surfaced this week.

Colorado Springs, CO ( 80903) Today Some clouds . Low 29F . Winds NNW at 5 to 10 mph. Tomorrow: Some clouds. High 29F. Low 28F. Saturday: Isolated showers in the morning. Saturday night: Becoming a steady rain.

Parents were horrified when they discovered instructions to commit suicide hidden in videos their kids watched every day. Counselor Hamlet Smith said parents should be involved in their child 's entertainment to avoid these problems. The good news is that the videos are n't easy to find . The bad news : they 're hard to spot when you do.

AT & T, Nestlé and Epic Games have withdrawn ads from YouTube. A viral video claimed it had hosted videos featuring young children that included comments from pedophiles. YouTube said any content that endangers minors is prohibited on its platform. The company said it is working on a new technology that helps classify predatory comments.

YouTube says the videos violate its policies against "harmful or dangerous '' acts. The videos had been brought to YouTube 's attention by BuzzFeed News. BuzzFeed said that some advertisers objected to their products being associated with vaccine opponents. The anti-vaccine video creators can still generate revenue in other ways, though.

We use a mix of filters , user feedback and human reviewers to keep the videos in YouTube Kids family friendly. But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through. We 're constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.

Video clips promoting Momo challenge are being spliced into seemingly innocent videos on YouTube and YouTube Kids. These include episodes of popular children 's TV shows such as Peppa Pig, as well as unboxing videos and Minecraft videos. The clips feature a chilling doll-like figure called Momo who encourages children to add her as a contact on WhatsApp. Once contact has been made, she hounds them with violent images and threats on WhatsApp, daring them to carry out acts of self-harm - and eventually suicide.

The Momo challenge is a dangerous new form of online bullying directed at adults and children. The Momo character will interrupt a show and forces the viewer to contact a number on YouTube. Some parents say their children have been told they will be killed in their sleep if they do not contact Momo. The police advise parents to do the following: Ensure they know what children can access online.

U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meet on Wednesday for their second summit. The Singapore meeting ended with great fanfare but little substance over how to dismantle North Korea 's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

The president has threatened to veto the resolution if it passes both the 435-member House and the 100-seat Senate. At least two Senate Republicans - Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina - have said they would back the resolution.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump are in Hanoi for their second summit. There has been a persistent suggestion that Kim will look around at the relative prosperity of his Vietnamese hosts. But opening up in the pursuit of wealth is for Kim an extremely dangerous proposition, analysts say.

Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee jumped into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary Friday with a promise to put climate change front and center in both his campaign and his potential presidency. The two-term governor, who previously served seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, enters a crowded field of candidates. But Inslee is betting that voters in early states will be drawn to his record and message on climate change.

Mr. Inslee has said in recent speeches that he would push the nation to global leadership in research and development of lower-carbon energy policies. But his base of support in his home state is also narrow. In his election to the governor 's office in 2012 , he carried only eight of the state 's 39 counties.

The mission that launched Saturday is an end-to-end test of the spacecraft. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 and says the objective of the company is to send people to space and eventually Mars. To date, the company has sent into space only satellites and cargo ( and one Tesla sports car )

SpaceX will launch its Crew Dragon spaceship into orbit for the first time ever on Saturday. The rocket launch wo n't send any people to space , but SpaceX is launching 400 lbs of cargo and a crash-test dummy. On Thursday, SpaceX revealed the mannequin has a female body and spacesuit. NASA said the dummy is part of its plan to instrument the crap out of '' Crew Dragon.

Israel seeks to become only the fourth country to successfully land on the moon. A communications satellite for Indonesia was the main cargo. The spacecraft - called Beresheet - will take nearly two months to reach moon. It will measure the magnetic field at the landing site and send back data and pictures.

Since the shuttle Atlantis returned to earth on July 21 , 2011 , no American astronaut has blasted off from US soil for a tour in space. SpaceX will try to send a dummy to the International Space Station this weekend in a key test for resuming manned US space flights. A Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to blast off Saturday from Cape Canaveral with a Crew Dragon capsule in its nose.

Six-day test flight will be real in every regard, beginning with a Florida liftoff Saturday. The Dragon capsule wo n't carry humans , rather a test dummy - named Ripley after the tough heroine in the Alien films. NASA does n't expect this crucial shakedown cruise to go perfectly . But the lessons learned should improve safety when two NASA astronauts strap into a Dragon as early as July.

SpaceX is targeting 2:49 a.m. Saturday for the premiere launch of a Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule. It will mark the first time a commercially built, human-rated spacecraft meets with the International Space Station. Crews have n't launched to the orbiting outpost since the space shuttle program 's last flight in July 2011.

Kallas is the daughter of the former Estonian prime minister Siim Kallas, who also led the Reform party before serving as a European commissioner.

The Centre Party will win the election by a few mandates. It will then enter difficult but successful coalition negotiations with its former arch-enemy Reform Party. The parties will likely be able to negotiate. This makes predicting the next government somewhat difficult, as the numbers are close enough that they might not work.

Heavy Colorado snowfall over the weekend led to a dangerous situation for drivers on Interstate 70. Several avalanches sent snow crashing out onto the highway in Summit County near Copper Mountain. Some cars got partially buried in the snow. No one was hurt , but the emergency situation led to the shutdown of the highway.

Copper has been around for far more decades and lifetimes than most of us can comprehend. The oldest-known copper ornament is a pendant discovered in modern-day Northern Iraq. It once hung from some or other wealthy man or woman 's neck almost a whole 11,000 years ago. It was the Egyptians who saw copper 's utility and used the metal to build entire water supply systems.

Avalanche roared through Ten Mile Canyon between Frisco and Copper Mountain. Avalanche debris collected in Tenmile Creek which is underneath the avalanche path and away from the highway. CDOT was doing avalanche mitigation along the I-70 corridor Sunday. The central mountains are under an avalanche warning until 6 a.m. Monday morning.

An avalanche rolled down Tenmile Canyon along Interstate 70 on Sunday. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center says the highway was n't affected, but debris collected in Tenmile Creek. No one was reportedly hurt in this incident. Shortly after 5 p.m. emergency crews responded to another avalanche down the road near Copper Mountain.

An avalanche has closed Interstate 70 by Copper Mountain on Sunday in the Officers Gulch area. A Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman said she did not believe it to be a large-scale avalanche.

Avalanche closes I-70 near Copper Mountain. No one was injured and no cars are trapped, Colorado State Patrol says. An earlier , separate avalanche in the same area was captured on video. This is a breaking story. Check back soon for more updates. The incident is under investigation.

An avalanche shortly after 5 p.m. forced Colorado highway authorities to close Interstate 70 in Summit County. State Patrol officials said eastbound I-70 was closed at Exit 196 near Copper Mountain. It remained unclear whether the avalanche in high mountains of Summit County slumped directly onto the highway. Heavy snow in the mountains created conditions favorable to avalanches.

Interstate 70 is closed at mile marker eastbound at Edwards to mile marker 203 in Summit County. No estimated time of re-opening . No estimate for when the highway will re-open. No estimate on when I-70 will reopen on the westbound side of the highway.

No vehicles were buried in the slide and no one was injured. The highway was closed between Edwards and Frisco for about an hour. Both directions reopened shortly after 6:00 p.m. CDOT is now in the process of clearing the highway. This was the second avalanche in the same area Sunday.



More than 20 people have been confirmed dead and several others were reported injured in Lee County, Alabama. Sheriff Jay Jones says children -- including an 8-year-old girl -- are among the dead and two people are in intensive care. Jones said the apparent twister traveled straight down a key local artery in Beauregard and that the path of damage appeared at least a half mile wide.

At least 23 people have been killed as tornadoes struck Lee County in eastern Alabama. Dozens are thought to have been hurt and there are fears the death toll could rise. Rescue efforts have been halted until dawn due to the danger of searching in the dark. The area around Beauregard appears to have borne the brunt of the damage.

Alabama beats South Alabama 7-3 in the opener of a three-game series. The Crimson Tide managed just one hit in five-plus innings against Jaguars starter Drake Nightengale.

Alabama fell short of what would have been a big win on Saturday . The Crimson Tide lost , 74-69 , to No . 13 LSU at Coleman Coliseum. Alabama took a 59-57 lead on a John Petty 3-pointer with 5:10 left in the second half. LSU answered with a corner 3 from Darius Days , which was the beginning of a 13-4 run.

Alabama used an offensive barrage and lights-out pitching in a doubleheader sweep of South Alabama. The Crimson Tide banged out 15 hits in a 10-5 victory in the early game, then limited the Jaguars to six hits in the nightcap. Those two wins combined with Friday 's 7-3 victory gave Alabama a three-game weekend sweep.

Sidney Umude scored 18 points with eight rebounds and Richard Lee scored 12. Lee 's 3-pointer with 16:43 before intermission gave the Jaguars a 6-5 lead and they never trailed again. Alabama A & M now has dropped three straight and five of the last six.

Alabama Power customers will be repaying about $ 740 million in costs related to the plant. Alabama Power spent more than $ 400 million at the plant since 2010 on upgrades. The company says it is forced to retire Plant Gorgas due to federal environmental mandates. Critics say the power company was spending too much money on keeping old coal plants in operation.

Plans call for the center to include a 5,000-seat air-conditioned arena. It could host livestock shows, rodeos, dog shows, festivals and other events. The facility could bring as many as 400 jobs and as much as $ 55 million in annual economic impact.

Alabama Power says customers will repay about $ 740 million in costs related to one of its coal-burning power plants. William Crawford Gorgas Electric Generating Plant is scheduled to close in April. The plant is located in Walker County near Parrish. Alabama Power has blamed the plant's retirement on federally driven environmental mandates.

Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) said that he will oppose President Trump 's national emergency declaration to fund a wall along the southern border. Paul 's stance makes him the crucial fourth Republican senator to support the resolution, marking a setback for the administration. The Senate is expected to vote on a resolution blocking the emergency declaration before leaving town for a weeklong recess set to begin on March 15.

Michael Gerson: The performance of Republicans at the Cohen hearing was in a class of its own. He says they impugn the reputations of the president 's accusers, as though the whole Republican Party had signed on as part of Trump 's legal team. Republicans are beginning to learn the lesson that Trump's narcissism is not completely unbound, he says.

U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Democrat of San Antonio, considers the declaration an unconstitutional power grab. He filed a resolution of disapproval, which would block Trump 's declaration from taking effect. The resolution passed the House on Tuesday on a 245-182 vote, and will be taken up this month in the Senate.

House Democrats have introduced a resolution to block the national emergency declaration. The move sets up a fight that could result in Trump 's first-ever veto. The Democratic-controlled House is sure to pass the measure and the GOP-run Senate may adopt it as well. Any Trump veto would likely be sustained but the upcoming battle will test Republican support.

Intel contributed the Thunderbolt protocol specification to the USB Promoter Group. The convergence of the underlying Thunderbolt and USB protocols will increase compatibility among USB Type-C connector-based products. The integration of Thunderbolt 3 into upcoming Intel processors is a win-win for the industry and consumers. Thunderbolt delivers world-class performance, ease-of-use and quality.

Intel has given the specification for its high-speed interconnect to the USB Implementers Forum. The USB-IF has taken the spec and will use it to form the basis of USB4. Thunderbolt 3 not only doubles the bandwidth of USB 3.2 Gen 2×2, it also enables the use of multiple data and display protocols simultaneously.

NEC has apparently won the race to push out the first certified SuperSpeed USB device. NEC 's host controller uses a PCIe gen 2 system to allow easy addition of two USB 3.0 interfaces. USB Implementers Forum has stated that it is the first of the next generation of products.

Ofcom has deregulated Ultra-Wideband. Belkin says it is having to trudge back to its R & D labs to mod its hardware for the European market. Ofcom has exempted the full spectrum from 1.6Ghz to 10Ghz from licencing.

The 6630 is a low-cost set-top box with no EPG or PVR upgradeability. USB port is provided for firmware upgrades and basic multimedia playback. Full DiSEqC compatibility and blind scan are also on board. But the lack of EPG is unforgivable nowadays.

The Technisat Skystar 2 USB is a 'desktop satellite ' USB solution for those who do n't want to open up their PCs. Powered by its own 'wall-wart ' , it 's a well-specified unit with a CI slot for pay-TV. Also included is a cut-down 'Technisat edition ' of DVBViewer catering for viewing, timeshifting and recording TV.

Specification defines next generation USB protocol architecture and doubling bandwidth to extend USB Type-C performance. The new USB4 architecture defines a method to share a single high-speed link with multiple end device types dynamically that best serves the transfer of data by type and application. Backward compatibility with USB 3.2 , USB 2.0 and Thunderbolt 3 devices is supported.

USB4 will support data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps using two-lane operation of 20Gbps each. That matches the speed of Thunderbolt 3 , the crown jewel of port technology. USB4 is based on Intel 's Thunderbolt protocol , which is now being shared among the USB Promoter Group.

German government plans to introduce a legal amendment for dual nationals who fight for a terror militia to lose their German citizenship. Individuals with multiple nationalities can already lose their citizenship if they fight for foreign army without permission from the German defence ministry. The amendment would therefore add participation in combat for a foreign militant group to the existing law.

President Donald Trump is carrying on the traditions of the Cold Warriors who toppled the Soviet Union, writes Tony Shaffer.

Cuba 's deep involvement in Venezuela is causing new tensions in the historically close relationship between Canada and Cuba.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez ' gift to the world was the genre of fiction known as 'magical realism . ' But Don Gabo 's fiction was informed by serious investigative journalism and diligent observation of the men and women of Colombia 's storied Atlantic Coast. On February 23, legitimate interim president Juan Guaido and his team of Venezuelan democrats failed to deliver tons of U.S. humanitarian assistance to Venezuela.

This past week, the UN Security Council debated two draft resolutions on Venezuela. The US demanded free elections and the opening of the border to aid deliveries. South Africa and China voted against the proposal, backing the Russian call for noninterference in Venezuelan politics. Equatorial Guinea also backed the Russian proposal, which failed to garner enough support.

Barr wrote a 19-page memo in which he argued that part of Mueller 's investigation into whether Trump had obstructed justice was fatally flawed. Barr said he would allow Mueller to finish his inquiry and would make as many of its findings public as he can. Former attorney general Jeff Sessions had recused himself from overseeing the probe after he failed to disclose at his own confirmation hearing meetings with the Russian ambassador.

Whatever one thinks of Mueller 's investigation , we should all be able to agree that it has revealed several potential weaknesses in our existing laws. Strengthening a future special counsel before we know who he is investigating or what he 's investigating would be an unusually-looking measure.

The U.S. last year posted the largest merchandise trade deficit in its 243-year history. The nation 's trade gap with China also is likely to set a record, underscoring the stakes for the president 's bid to reach a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The president thus begins his reelection drive with a core campaign promise unfulfilled.

The U.S. trade deficit in 2018 widened to decade-long high of $ 621 billion. China imbalance widened to record-large gap in the same year. The gap with China is the largest in the world, followed by the gap with Russia. The U.N. says the world's two largest economies are at odds over trade policy.



Huawei is suing the U.S. over a law that bans government agencies from buying the Chinese technology giant 's equipment. The lawsuit focuses on a provision in a law known as the National Defense Authorization Act. Huawei has faced intense pressure from President Donald Trump 's administration, which claims the company's equipment could be used for espionage.

Zhang Yesui said U.S. officials were taking China 's national security law out of context and playing up the so-called security risks associated with Chinese companies. The comments by Zhang Yesui followed news that Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is suing the Canadian government over her treatment. Meng is due in court tomorrow to set a date for the extradition proceedings to start.

Meng Wanzhou is out on bail awaiting possible extradition to the U.S. on fraud charges. She is holed up at her other Vancouver home, a six-bedroom house worth approximately 6 million Canadian dollars ( $ 4.5 million) Three months after her arrest, Meng has become both a subject of curiosity and a polarizing figure in Vancouver.

China accuses two detained Canadians of acting together to steal state secrets. China arrested the two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng Wanzhou. Meng is the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies. Her arrest set off a diplomatic furor and has severely strained Canadian relations with China.

Meng Wanzhou claims that her constitutional rights were breached and is seeking damages for an ordeal she says amounted to false imprisonment. Meng 's claim was filed the same day that the Canadian government agreed to proceed to an extradition hearing at the request of the US. China has accused Canada of abetting ' a political persecution ' against its biggest technology company.

The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Thursday denied bail to Percoco pending the appeal of his March 2016 corruption conviction. An appeals court judge last week temporarily stayed Caproni 's order until a three-judge panel could hear the oral arguments that were held Wednesday.

Cody Weddle was at the main Caracas-area airport waiting for a U.S.-bound flight, according to the TV station he works for in Miami. A doorman at his residence said a squad of five men wearing black uniforms demanded entry and left with the journalist in custody. The State Department issued a warning to President Nicolás Maduro 's government. Tensions have been escalating by the day in Venezuela.

The mother of Cody Weddle, a 29-year-old Virginia native who is based in Caracas, confirmed to Fox News that he has been released. The journalist was covering opposition leader Juan Guaido 's triumphant return to Venezuela for WPLG when the country 's counterintelligence military raided his apartment around 8 a.m. The U.S. State Department confirmed earlier Wednesday that it was aware of and deeply concerned with reports that another American journalist has been detained by President Nicolas Maduro.

Finland 's coalition government resigned on Friday a month ahead of a general election. Reform has been controversial and plans to cut costs and boost efficiency have stalled. The government had aimed to dramatically slow the increase in healthcare spending over the next decade. Critics said the scale of the projected savings was unrealistic.

Health Minister Gan Kim Yong shared that since 2010, national healthcare spending had almost doubled , from $ 11 billion to $ 21 billion in 2016. Subsidies given out also had also risen from $ 2.6billion to $ 5.6 billion. But this trajectory can not be sustained , he said. Individuals have to do their part in keeping healthy.

The Centre Party will decide on Friday whether or not it will enter coalition talks with the election-winning Reform Party. Reform won the 3 March elections , earning 34 seats in the 101-seat Riigikogu. Centre came in second , earning 26 seats , and the Conservative People 's Party of Estonia ( EKRE ) in third with 19 seats. Isamaa placed fourth overall , earning 12 seats , while the Social Democratic Party ( SDE ) will be the smallest party in the new Riigkogu with 10 seats.

The US spent $ 10,209 on healthcare per capita in 2017, according to data from OECD. That 's more than any other country in OECD 's 36-country consortium, and over $ 2,000 more than Switzerland.

Venezuela 's worst power and communications outage on Friday deepened a sense of isolation and decay. President Nicolas Maduro ordered schools and all government entities closed and told businesses not to open. The blackout marked another harsh blow to a country paralyzed by turmoil as the power struggle between Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido stretches into its second month and economic hardship grows.

Venezuela endured one of its worst blackouts in recent memory this week. The government repeatedly claimed the outage was due to a foreign cyberattack attempting to unseat its president. The idea of a foreign nation state manipulating an adversary 's power grid to force a governmental transition is very real.

Venezuelan Minister of Communication and Information Jorge Rodriguez said on Saturday that the country 's near-total blackout has been caused by a cyberattack against the Guri hydroelectric power plant. Rodriguez claimed the outage could have been staged by the US. He said that a delegation headed by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet will visit Venezuela in the next few days.

Venezuela is still reeling from a nationwide blackout that left most of the country in darkness. A Maduro government official said a cyber-attack is likely the reason for the blackout. The official went on to hint that US Senator and anti-Maduro campaigner Marco Rubio may be linked to the offensive.

Venezuela 's nationwide crippling power outage goes into days , rather than hours. The scale of the latest blackouts indicate an unprecedented damage to the country 's power infrastructure. Washington 's rapid reaction to the latest power calamity is suggestive of a premeditated act. The tactic here is to inflict as much hardship and misery on Venezuelans - and then tell them the price for relief is to topple President Maduro.

Some parts of Venezuela 's power grid have reportedly begun to come back online after the country was plunged into nation-wide darkness beginning Thursday evening. The defense ministry previously vowed to put more security patrols on the streets after dark as already high-crime areas of Caracas are now considered no-go zones. This as official accusations against Washington for conducting what Maduro previously called a US `` electricity war '' have become even more strident.

Venezuela endured one of its worst blackouts in recent memory this week. The government repeatedly claimed the widespread outage was due to a foreign cyberattack attempting to unseat its president. The idea of a foreign nation state manipulating an adversary 's power grid to force a governmental transition is very real.

Electrical systems in Venezuela have been targeted by another cyberattack, President Nicholas Maduro has said. The country 's grid took another hammering on Saturday, with many of the restored systems knocked out once again. The Venezuelan government blamed Thursday 's blackout on US 's sabotage. US officials blame local corruption and mismanagement for the blackout.

The blackout hit 22 of 23 states, according to the Associated Press. It struck the capital Caracas at the peak of rush hour. Venezuela 's socialist government blasted the outage as an electrical war '' directed by the United States. Critics say corruption and under investment have left the power grid unable to function.



'Empire ' actor Jussie Smollett hit with 16 count felony indictment by grand jury. Illinois grand jury has indicted the actor on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. The grand jury returned two separate sets of charges, a senior advisor in the state attorney's office said.

Jussie Smollett, an actor on the American drama series '' Empire , '' grabbed the media 's attention when he filed a police report that he had been assaulted by two men while walking home. The report claimed that the men shouted racial and homophobic slurs and attempted to put a noose around his neck. After the Chicago Police Department investigated, it announced on Feb. 21 that Smollet was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for filing a fake police report.

The Chicago Police have opened an internal investigation into the Jussie Smollett case. In January, the actor told police that he was attacked by two masked men as he was walking home from a sandwich shop in the early morning on Jan. 29. The actor is accused of filing a false police report and was charged last month with felony disorderly conduct. If convicted , he will face up to three years behind bars.

The investigation was recently opened by the Chicago PD 's Chief of Detectives due to concerns that someone within the force was leaking the information. Investigators indicated that 'inaccurate ' information about the Smollett case made its way into the media and the department wants to determine how it got out. It comes as dozens of nurses claim they were fired for looking at Smollet 's medical records after he was treated in the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on January 29.

Since suffering a stroke in 2013, Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been ill and unable to move. But that has not stopped him and his men from setting their sights on a surreal fifth mandate. So where does his power come from ? And what are the reasons why he could ultimately prove weak?

The Gulfstream 4SP had not been tracked leaving Algeria since Algerian authorities announced in February that he would be travelling to the Swiss city for unspecified medical checks. The president has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, prompting critics to question whether he is being used as a puppet candidate by a faction of civilian and military figures. Massive protests began on February 22 to denounce his plans to extend his rule in the April 18 election.

President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is expected to return to Algeria on Sunday after two weeks in a Swiss hospital. Mass protests pose the biggest threat to his 20-year-old rule. Tens of thousands of people of all social classes have protested over his decision to stand in April 's election.

President Bouteflika suffered a stroke six years ago and can hardly walk or talk. His last known public address was in 2014 - a victory speech to thank Algerians for their renewed confidence in his leadership. The opposition has historically been too divided - and as the president grew older and frailer the bickering within the ruling elite has paralysed political change.

The vote is sure to intensify calls for her to either step down or call a general election. Plenty of Conservative lawmakers would like to take her place as party leader and prime minister. But there is no obvious front-runner , and the outcome of a general elections is just as unclear.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to reveal on Monday what changes she has secured to her EU divorce deal. Parliament overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal agreement May has struck with the European Union two months ago. MPs prepare to vote again on the deal on Tuesday, prompting warnings of another humiliating defeat. Failure means Britain could end 46 years of ties with its closest trading partner with no new arrangements in place.

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says there is "wind in the sails of people trying to stop Brexit" Two major eurosceptic factions in parliament warned that Prime Minister Theresa May was facing a heavy defeat. May is scrambling - so far unsuccessfully - to secure last-minute changes to an EU exit treaty before parliament votes on Tuesday on whether to approve the deal. Parliament rejected May 's deal by 230 votes on 15 January.

Britain 's long goodbye to the European Union often seems to be spoken in unintelligible code. Here is a look at some of the terms -- both real and invented -- politicos are using to describe a split that could very well run past its March 29 deadline. Most know the process as Brexit -- a child of the term Grexit that was coined by economists when it looked like Greece would exit the eurozone in 2012.

Failure means Britain could end 46 years of ties with its closest trading partner on March 29 with no new arrangements.

If Theresa May 's deal is rejected by Parliament on Tuesday MPs will then vote on whether to leave the EU without a deal. Should Parliament reject that , as looks likely , a third vote will take place on requesting a delay to Brexit. This would take place by extending the official Article 50 exit mechanism. However any extension to Article 50 require the approval of all 27 other EU members.

Downing Street admits talks are 'deadlocked' just one day before crucial vote. Theresa May will again table her deal for leaving the EU for a meaningful vote on Tuesday. Some of her MPs are warning her she faces another three-figure defeat in the House of Commons. Conservative Brexiteers have said rejection of the deal again is 'inevitable'

Talks between the UK and the EU remain deadlocked, Downing Street says. Theresa May spoke to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday night. Talks will resume on Monday morning with the aim of securing changes to the deal. MPs are due to vote again on Theresa May 's deal on Tuesday.

Researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology teamed up with colleagues from the U.S. and Switzerland. They returned the state of a quantum computer a fraction of a second into the past. They also calculated the probability that an electron in empty interstellar space will spontaneously travel back into its recent past.

Scientists have reversed the direction of time with a quantum computer. The breakthrough study seems to contradict basic laws of physics. It could alter our understanding of the processes governing the universe. Anyone watching the computer would see the event as if time had turned backwards. The researchers expect the technique to improve , becoming more reliable and precise with time.

Bloomberg TV's Michael Bancroft spoke of the growing popularity of blockchain technology. He said that before too long, we 're likely to see it employed for cybersecurity. IBM has doubled the power of its quantum computers annually since 2017. The quantum revolution is coming, and if our financial industry and companies who do cybersecurity insurance have been slow in getting the message, the federal government is n't.

A research group at Hebrew University of Jerusalem has proven that artificial intelligence ( AI ) can help us understand the world on an infinitesimally small scale. Quantum physics phenomena is one of the hottest topics in contemporary physics.

Physicists in Russia have turned back time using a quantum computer. The second law of thermodynamics posits that an isolated system can only remain static or evolve toward a state of chaos. Scientists used an evolution program on the quantum computer to trigger the degradation of order. This caused the qubits to evolve from chaos to order.

Researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology claim to have reversed time with the help of a quantum computer. The experiment used quantum computer programs to 'rewind ' scattered quantum bits or qubits back to their starting points. The scientists found that , working with just two qubits , time reversal was achieved with a success rate of 85 per cent.

A dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats on Thursday to overturn President Trump 's declaration of a national emergency. The 59-to-41 vote on a measure already approved by the House set up the first veto of Mr. Trump's presidency. It was the latest sign that the cautious Republican majority in the Senate was beginning to reassert its authority.

White House and Republican senators sought compromise Tuesday on limiting future presidents ' powers to unilaterally declare national emergencies. As a Thursday showdown vote in the Senate neared, GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and others were talking with the White House about related legislation. If Trump would commit to signing a bill handcuffing future emergency declarations, more GOP senators might support his border emergency declaration.

Chances seem to be improving that President Donald Trump might avoid an expected rejection by Congress. If Trump commits to signing legislation handcuffing future emergency declarations, more GOP senators might vote against a separate bill. Senate passage of the resolution rejecting the border emergency would send it to the White House, where it would face a veto.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee introduced legislation Tuesday to curb the president 's power to declare a national emergency. The bill comes just days before the Senate plans to vote on a resolution to reverse President Donald Trump 's emergency declaration on border security. Vice President Mike Pence has reportedly discussed a deal with Republican senators in which Trump would sign Lee 's legislation.

Senate rejection of Trump border emergency no longer certain. President Donald Trump called for deep cuts in federal spending, billions more for his proposed border wall and a significant boost for the military.

TPG Capital has placed executive Bill McGlashan on indefinite administrative leave after he was named in a criminal probe of bribery and cheating in college admissions. On Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney in Massachusetts charged 50 people , from television stars , to business leaders , and university coaches of using alleged bribery. The schemes were organized by Rick Singer , an owner of a college counseling and admissions company called The Edge College & Career Network.

Jeffrey Selingo: We 're seeing this more , that the seats are scarce at these - at the selective colleges and universities. There are more people every year trying to get into them . They represent about a third of applications every year , even though they only represent about 18 percent of students , the most elite colleges.

Rick Singer pleaded guilty Tuesday to racketeering, money laundering, tax evasion and obstruction of justice. Federal prosecutors revealed those secrets in hundreds of pages of court documents Tuesday. Dozens of wealthy and well-connected parents got their under-qualified children into elite colleges. The scandal has implicated celebrity actors such as Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman.

Federal indictments unsealed in Boston on Tuesday outlined a sweeping college admissions bribery scandal. The charges touch lower-profile sports such as tennis, sailing and water polo. The indictments expose how coaches and schools use lists of `` designated recruits '' to bypass normal admissions requirements. The schools involved will wait to hear from the NCAA about possible infractions.

Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman are being charged in a large-scale college entrance exam cheating scam. Bob Greene: Why did n't we think of bribing a good college with a truckload of money? He says if you have the money to bribe your way into college , you already have so many advantages it 's almost impossible to quantify. Greene: Every parent wants what 's best for their kids, and some lucky ones have that.

Some local students and parents are outraged after hearing about the college admissions bribery scandal. They say everyone should be treated fairly. Cheating is one of many accusations in an indictment charging dozens of people. Prosecutors said parents paid a college test prep organization to help students cheat, either by having stand-ins take the tests.

Nearly 50 people have been charged in a wide-ranging scandal in which wealthy people are accused of paying millions of dollars to fabricate their children 's credentials during the college-admissions process. Usually, the ultra-wealthy manipulate the process in simpler ways. In a few cases, leaked emails and court records show how donations hold sway over the admissions process in elite colleges.

Felicity Huffman had to hand over her passport before she was released. Her husband, William H. Macy, had to sign that he 's good for it. Lori Loughlin was not arrested Tuesday because she 's out of town. But her husband Mossimo Giannulli was and had to see the judge.

FBI's Operation Varsity Blues centers on a college-prep guru accused of helping parents craft fraudulent athletic records for their children. The defendants in the case include nine college coaches who are said to have received bribes. Most elite schools recruit athletes in these sports, typically setting aside copious slots in each freshman class for students with athletic talent.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May 's deal suffered a major blow ahead of a historic vote yesterday. Her chief attorney ruled that risks from its most contentious points remained unchanged. Failure to agree could spark economic chaos if Britain crashes out of the European Union without a deal on the scheduled departure date of March 29.

The pound tumbled on Tuesday after the UK government 's top legal advisor cast doubt on Prime Minister Theresa May 's last-gasp changes.

The U.S. is no longer demanding that North Korea provide a full accounting of its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The decision to drop the demand could indicate that North Korean does not plan on fully denuclearizing. Negotiations between the two countries are also reportedly heavily focused on North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear reactor.

Satellite photos showing new activity at a North Korean rocket launch site raised fresh doubts that Kim Jong Un will ever give up his drive for nuclear weapons. Yet talks continue and President Donald Trump said he was still hoping for the agreement that eluded the leaders at last week 's summit. South Korea 's military said it is carefully monitoring North Korean nuclear and missile facilities.

President Trump and Kim Jong Un failed to reach a deal in Hanoi, writes Julian Zelizer. Zelizer says the U.S. is doubling down on its approach to North Korea.

'' Never before has a president asked for funding , Congress has not provided it and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway , '' Senator Lamar Alexander said. Senator Jerry Moran said he thought Mr. Trump 's declaration was unconstitutional. The president said on Friday that he understood why some Republicans believed he had overreached.

President Donald Trump has used executive orders to tackle some of his most notable policy items. Some say the debate over Trump 's emergency declaration could define a question at the heart of the American democratic system. The Deseret News spoke to a presidential historian, a senator, and a U.S. ambassador to get their take.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. John Avlon: Congress has expressly and explicitly declined to authorize the funds for the construction of such a barrier. He says a federal court will soon decide whether the status of matters at the southern border rises to the level of emergency. Avlon says a court will enjoin the enforcement of Trump 's declaration because it does not fit within the definition of an emergency.

Congressional Republicans almost uniformly have sided with President Donald Trump. But his decision to declare a national emergency to divert funds for a border wall is generating pushback. John Avlon: Maybe this is the start of something that is long overdue: lawmakers claiming responsibility. He says if members do n't like how Trump is using his emergency powers, they can take them away.

The Republican-led Senate is set to deal President Donald Trump a rebuke on his declaration of a national emergency at the Mexican border. The only remaining question is how many GOP senators will join Democrats in defying him. Republicans are predicting that Thursday 's showdown vote will result in Congress sending Trump a resolution blocking the border emergency.

Asteroid exploded in the Earth 's atmosphere in December that had 10 times the energy than the Hiroshima atomic bomb. A meteor that size swings by two or three times every 100 years. NASA was reportedly alerted about the Dec. 18 blast over the Bering Sea by the U.S. Air Force.

NASA researchers create atmosphere of a super-hot planet outside our solar system. Scientists heat mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1,100 Celsius ) Aim was to simulate conditions that might be found in atmospheres of a type of exoplanets called 'hot Jupiters'

The explosion was detected by US military satellites last year. It was 10 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The explosion was only 40 % as powerful as the Chelyabinsk meteor strike in 2013. Scientists say new research into a Russian meteor shower in February shows the Earth is 'vulnerable '

The explosion occurred in December over the Bering Sea. The meteor measured several metres in diameter and exploded around 25.6km above Earth 's surface. The blast was picked up by the US Air Force 's military satellites. NASA is now checking with airlines to see if anyone spotted the explosion.

NASA has reported a meteor blast above the Bering Sea. The spectacular blast was the second largest of its kind in 30 years. It was the biggest since the fireball over Chelyabinsk in Russia six years ago.

New Zealand may tighten gun control in the wake of Friday 's mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch. Experts in Canada say these sorts of violent tragedies have previously spurred changes in gun control policy. New Zealand does n't have to look too far beyond its borders for an example of a country that changed gun control laws following a mass shooting.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan showed video footage at an election rally on Saturday from an attack on two New Zealand mosques which killed 50 people.

The atrocious murders of 50 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand has rightly shocked the world. New Zealand 's laxer gun laws explain partly why the twisted gunman who perpetrated Friday 's murders chose to carry out his act where he did. The fact that it was New Zealand , however, shows that it could be…

ISIS Camp In Baghouz Is Captured As U.S . Allies Declare Progress In Syria. But isolated gun battles are continuing in the area, seen as ISIS ' last remaining redoubt. More than 60,000 people have poured out of this area in the past two months.

Four U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing in Syria on Jan. 16. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, which was the deadliest assault on American troops in Syria since American forces went into the country in 2015. A senior Pentagon official was unable to confirm at what level these fighters were involved, if at all.

The battle to capture the extremist group 's last patch of territory in eastern Syria has dragged on for weeks. The sheer number of people who have emerged from Baghouz has taken the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces by surprise. Most have been women and children whose existence in a labyrinth of underground caves and tunnels was unknown to the fighters.

The nasal-spray form of the mind-altering drug will be available to patients as early as this week in select DEA-approved clinics. Psychiatrists can only prescribe this treatment to patients who have already unsuccessfully tried two other antidepressants.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge believe they have identified a link between these two conditions. Inflammation - the body 's response to negative environmental factors , such as stress. While inflammation is a natural response necessary to fight off infection, chronic inflammation - which may result from psychological stress - is harmful.

Depression and heart disease are not connected through a common genetic association, a study says. unhealthy risk factors that bring about both conditions are to blame, researchers say. People who 've had at least one parent die of heart disease had a 20 percent increased risk of developing depression. Risk factors for both conditions produce IL-6 and CRP , two inflammatory markers.

Theresa May has written to the EU seeking a brief delay to Brexit until the end of June. She told MPs that a longer delay would mean a failure to deliver on the 2016 referendum.

Education minister Nadhim Zahawi warned that the move reduced the chance of Britain leaving the EU. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the Government was facing a major constitutional crisis.

John Bercow said he would not allow the government to present May 's EU withdrawal agreement to the House for a third vote. He said the deal must be substantially different from the first two times it was voted down. May suffered humiliating defeat in the two earlier votes. Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29.

Speaker John Bercow may have just put an end to UK Prime Minister Theresa May 's plans to bring the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement back for a third meaningful vote. He suggested that May would be allowed to put a deal before the House if it was substantially different from the withdrawal agreement proposed during the previous two votes. A precedent from 1604 does not allow for the same fundamental proposition '' to be put to the Commons again.

John Bercow said he would not permit another meaningful vote unless the Government had made significant changes to its plans. Downing Street was blindsided by the move which leaves the Prime Minister 's proposal struggling to stay afloat. Mrs May is now expected to ask EU leaders for a long extension to Brexit beyond March 29 at a crunch summit in Brussels at the end of this week.

The announcement hands Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a significant foreign policy victory. The move comes just days before Netanyahu is set to join Trump at the White House. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six-Day War of 1967 and formally annexed the territory in 1981.

The United States signaled last week that it is moving to officially recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israeli territory. If the US does so , then it forfeits any moral authority to sanction Russia over allegations of annexing Crimea. Such a move totally prohibits Washington from posturing with presumed principle over the issue of Crimea.

The United States signaled last week that it is moving to officially recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israeli territory. If the US does so , then it forfeits any moral authority to sanction Russia over allegations of annexing Crimea. In 1981, Tel Aviv formally annexed the Syrian territory but the UN Security Council in 1981 unanimously condemned the annexation as illegal.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the Middle East this week to meet leaders. Pompeo visited Israel Wednesday and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the two will make a joint statement detailing their talks. One item up for discussion is reunifying the Gulf Cooperation Council that once included Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

Washington last week gave another sign that the Trump administration is moving towards declaring the Golan Heights to be Israeli sovereign territory. At the heart of the move are huge anticipated US-Israeli oil profits. Israel has occupied the strategically important area overlooking the Jordan Valley since the 1967 Six Day War.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. Netanyahu called on the international community to recognize Israeli sovereignty over areas of the Golan Heights. Pompeo spoke of a Middle East conference in Warsaw last month that included Arab nations as well as Israel. He also noted Iranian calls for Israel 's destruction.

Jair Bolsonaro has been wooing the US 's dealmaker-in-chief for a while now. But when he met Trump on Tuesday it seemed that something was missing for a veritable bromance to blossom. Both countries produce the same goods and are global competitors in meat, soy, maize and cars.

Ali Musa Daqduq joined Hezbollah a quarter of a century ago. He was involved in attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. The recruits come from the town of Quneitra and several villages. They patrol the border to familiarize themselves with the terrain and analyze infiltration routes.

Donald Trump appears to be paying it forward to Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu is facing a credible challenge on April 9 from Benny Gantz. Gantz will be in Washington next week to address the American Israel Affairs Committee. The White House could have a meeting with Gantz, but there is no sign that is happening.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo headed to the Middle East Tuesday for regional security talks. Pompeo plans to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government is headed to a tough April 9 re-election contest. Netanyahu is embroiled in a corruption investigation and faces allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.



The European Union is poised to take control of Britain 's exit by rejecting Theresa May 's request for a three-month delay and setting a new withdrawal date of no later than 22 May. The prime minister is seeking an extension of the negotiating period to 30 June to allow the necessary legislation to be passed. But EU ambassadors at a meeting late on Wednesday night agreed that the risks of having the UK as a member state beyond 23 May were too high.

If May 's deal is not passed by Commons thenBrexit will be delayed only until 12 April. The EU has handed Theresa May two weeks ' grace to devise an alternative plan if her deal falls next week. May failed to convince the bloc that she was capable of avoiding a no-deal Brexit.

Speaker rules out third vote unless Mrs. May 's deal is re-submitted in fundamentally different form. One way to bring May's deal back for a vote could be prorogation - ending the parliament session prematurely and starting a new one. The pound fell to its day 's low against the euro and the dollar on Bercow 's statement.

The Blithering Bercow has robbed us of the ultimate irony - the Prime Minister using EU tactics to get her way over Brexit. But all is not lost - Theresa May should go to Brussels tomorrow, put on a magnificent show of ice-cold fury and tell 'em straight. The Commons can then take its pick and decide on an orderly withdrawal or a diamond-studded constitutional crisis.

Theresa May is reluctant to ask the EU for anything but a short extension. But with no sign that her opponents are prepared to budge the EU yesterday publicly warned the prime minister such a request could be rejected. The Irish foreign minister said there was no appetite among EU leaders to kick the 'can down the road'

EU leadership is on a backbreaking exercise to position itself between a geopolitical/geoeconomic rock and a hard place. The 28-member EU holds a crucial meeting next week in Brussels where it may adopt a 10-point action plan detailing the terms of an equitable economic relationship with China going forward.

Government sources reportedly told Sky News the under-fire Tory leader will ask for a short extension. A new date of June 30 has been set, Sky's political correspondent Tamara Cohen said. This follows a blazing row at the cabinet yesterday with some minsters saying it must be short - so there is the possibility of us leaving without a deal.

The deadline for Britain to leave the EU is just barely a week away. Here is a layman 's guide to Brexit . A long time ago in Europe it is hard to believe it now but at some point our former colonial masters ruled over an empire the likes of which has never been seen. The problem is that there is a deadline to leaving the EU and there is just over a week left.

Government sources reportedly told Sky News the under-fire Tory leader will ask for a short extension. A new date of June 30 for Brexit day has been reported as a goal. This follows a blazing row at the cabinet yesterday with some minsters saying it must be short - so there is the possibility of us leaving without a deal at the end of June.

Michel Barnier said any extension to Article 50 has to be 'useful' He warned it would cause 'uncertainty' and cost the EU 'political cost' This comes after MPs voted to delay the scheduled date of 29 March. The EU has previously reminded the UK Parliament that all 27 member states need to agree before Britain can delay Brexit.



All military-style semi-automatic weapons, assault rifles and high-capacity magazines will be banned in New Zealand.

Hundreds of mostly Muslim mourners gathered in a Christchurch cemetery today for the first funerals of those killed in the twin mosque massacre. Among those in attendance was Abdul Aziz , an Afghan refugee who bravely confronted the gunman at Linwood Mosque. Muslims whose loved ones were gunned down have had their grief compounded by the failure of authorities to return bodies to families in time for a speedy burial. Only six of the 50 victims have been returned to their families so far. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern today visited Cashmere High School which lost two students in the shootings.

Relatives of those killed in last week 's shootings in New Zealand began to bury the dead. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern renewed her call to remember the 50 victims rather than the white supremacist accused of slaughtering them. Hundreds of people were gathered at a grave designated for Muslim burials as the first two funerals got under way.

Jeffrey Skilling has been holding meetings with former Enron executives and others. He is hoping to win backing for a new energy venture, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Skilling served more than 12 years in prison for his role in one of the biggest corporate scandals.

Jeffrey Skilling is looking to get back into the energy business, with a little help from his friends. He has been holding meetings with former Enron executives and others, hoping to win backing for a new energy venture. At least one former colleague has agreed to support Mr. Skilling 's comeback attempt: Lou L. Pai.

Jeffrey Skilling has been holding meetings with former Enron executives and others. Skilling resigned as chief executive officer of Enron in August 2001. He was arrested in 2004 and two years later convicted of 19 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, insider trading and lying to auditors. Skilled was released from federal custody last month.

Former Enron Chief Executive Jeff Skilling is out of prison after 12 years. He 's getting the old gang back together again. Skilling 's new project is said to be a digital platform that connects investors to oil and gas projects. He has met with individuals who specialize in cryptocurrency and blockchain because - well , because of course he has.

Skilling came up with the idea while serving a federal prison sentence for his role in Enron 's 2001 collapse. He has been meeting with friends and former colleagues since his release into a residential re-entry program in Houston last August. News of his possible return to the industry was first reported Friday by the Wall Street Journal.

John Fullerton places the word on a spectrum of approaches. At one end you have conventional economics . At the other you have the regenerative economics that he pioneered. Conventional economics is degenerative . It depletes resources and fills up waste sinks.

Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez delivered their announcements Sunday. The announcements were welcomed by Israeli politicians.

President Donald Trump said it 's time for the U.S. to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The move is at odds with longstanding international policy around the territory. Netanyahu is scheduled to visit the White House next week before he faces a tough re-election vote.

Edmonton Omar Khadr 's war crimes sentence is finished, Alberta judge rules.

After the judge left the courtroom, a beaming Khadr embraced his lawyer.

Omar Khadr has served more than seven years in custody and on bail. His application asks the judge to place Khadr under conditional supervision for one day then declare his sentence served.

US President Donald Trump on Monday formally recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. The announcement came as Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in a trip the Israeli prime minister said he cut short after an early morning rocket struck a home in central Israel. Israel began striking Hamas targets in Gaza later on Monday. Hamas had earlier denied its movement was behind the overnight rocket.

The Syrian government called it a threat to international peace and stability. Iran 's foreign ministry said it plunges the region into a new crisis. The U.S. will be the first country to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The announcement was a major shift in American policy and gives Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu a political boost.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested in a televised interview Thursday that God may have sent President Donald Trump to Earth to protect Israel. Pompeo made the remarks in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network, or CBN, in Jerusalem. Thursday is Purim, the holiday that commemorates the rescue of the Jewish people from genocide on the orders of Haman.

Netanyahu and Trump have a mutually beneficial relationship. They see eye to eye on many issues, including the Middle East. Trump appreciates the praise Netanyahu has lavished upon him. Boosting Israel plays well with his political base, which is heavy with conservative Christians. It will also divert attention away from his pressing domestic concerns.

Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Faysal al-Mikdad said in an interview with al-Mayadeen TV on Friday. He said the United States is the biggest rogue state in the world as it sponsors terrorism and defies international resolutions. He reiterated that the people of the Golan will continue resisting the Israeli occupation 's attempts to displace them and judaize their lands.

The Golan Heights has been occupied by Israel since 1967. The international community has not recognized Israel 's claim to the Syrian territory. The bill frames U.S. recognition of the Golan as a means of countering Iran. This is just window dressing for the Israeli government push to consolidate its control over the territory.

The Golan Heights are Syrian lands that were occupied by Israel during its 1967 war of aggression against Egypt and Syria. The Heights are of strategic-military value. Whoever controls them can also control the plains east, west and south to it. Israel built several radar and spy station on the heights that allow it to see deep into Syria. This profile picture falsely depicts the occupied Heights territory as Israeli.

US Duplicity over Golan Demolishes Posturing on Crimea. In a controversial snub to international law , the United States signaled last week that it is moving to officially recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israeli territory. If the US does so , then it forfeits any moral authority to sanction Russia over allegations of annexing Crimea.

US President Donald Trump 's pledge to recognize Israel 's annexation of the Golan Heights slammed as a violation of international law. Syria, its allies and fellow states in the region condemned the move. Russia warned the policy U-turn could spark new conflicts. Israel seized from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.

The Syrian government called it a threat to international peace and stability. Iran's foreign ministry said it plunges the region into a new crisis. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said it brought the region to the brink of a crisis. Egypt also issued a statement, saying the Golan is occupied Arab territory.



A rocket fired from the Gaza Strip hit a house belonging to a British-Israeli family. This is the furthest a Palestinian rocket has reached in Israel since the 2014 conflict with militants in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to the US over the attack and vowed to respond with force. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system was not activated.

Israeli military aircraft bombed Hamas targets in the Gaza strip early Sunday as Palestinians rioted along the border in renewed nighttime demonstrations. The strikes came less than an hour after a rocket alarm sounded in some Israeli communities bordering the strip , triggered by an improvised bomb thrown at the border. Nighttime riots in Gaza have been led by so-called confusion units organized by the Hamas terror group.

The 24-year-old man was fatally shot in the chest, the Hamas-run health ministry said. There was no immediate comment or confirmation by the army. Israeli military aircraft bombed Hamas targets in Gaza after a rocket alarm sounded in some Israeli communities. The Israel Defense Forces said aircraft struck two Hamas reconnaissance posts.

A suspected explosive device landed Sunday morning in a field in the Sha'ar Hanegev region near the Gaza Strip. A police sapper was called to the scene to remove the object, which was flown into Israel from Gaza by a cluster of balloons. On Saturday night, Israeli military aircraft bombed Hamas targets in Gaza after a rocket alarm sounded in some Israeli communities. A Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire during the clashes early Sunday, authorities in the Strip said.

The investigative commission of the United Nations Human Rights Council that examined the most recent round of violence on the Israel-Gaza border presented its findings on Thursday. The panel recommended that UN members consider imposing individual sanctions , such as a travel ban or freezing the assets of those identified as responsible by the commission. The UN commission also recommended that materials it collected be transferred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

The United Nations Human Rights Council adopted five resolutions condemning Israel on Friday. One related to accusations of Israeli abuses in the Golan Heights passed by a tally of 26 in favor, 16 against and five abstentions. Another was about alleged Israeli violations in the Palestinian territories. A third condemned Israel building settlements in Judea and Samaria.

Israel fears events may spin out of control with dozens of casualties and a possible military confrontation. The only way to stave off this frightening scenario is to implement the partial understandings reached between Egypt , Israel and Hamas. Israel agreed to allow Hamas to expand the Gaza fishing zone to 12 nautical miles from the Gaza coast. Israel also agreed to provide Gaza with additional electricity capacity.

Naftali Bennett accuses political rivals ex-army chief Benny Gantz and former defense minister Moshe Ya'alon of being responsible for the deaths of two IDF soldiers. Bennett claims the operation under which Sarel was killed and Goldin kidnapped was done under terrible rules of engagement. The bodies of both soldiers are believed to be held by Hamas.

Israeli troops went house to house overnight in search of the assailant. Ahiad Ettinger , a 47-year-old father of 12, died of his wounds from the shooting and stabbing attack. The attack also killed a soldier and seriously wounded another soldier. Israel often demolishes homes of alleged Palestinian assailants or their families.

The Israeli Air Force has struck at least two 'Hamas outposts ' in Gaza in retaliation for what the IDF claimed was an overnight barrage of some '300 explosives ' thrown across the border fence at Israeli troops. The strike came in response to ongoing border disturbances by Hamas ' so-called `` night-time unit '' which staged a massive demonstration along the Gazan border with Israel on Saturday.



Israel launched air strikes on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza and deployed extra troops to the border. After a day of intense cross-border fighting, Palestinian officials said Egypt had mediated a ceasefire. Rocket sirens sounded in southern Israel after the late-night truce was supposed to take effect. Five Palestinians were later wounded by a wave of retaliatory strikes.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington. He will also deliver an address at AIPAC 's annual Policy Conference. Netanyahu will stay at the Blair 's House, the official White House guest residence. Israeli voters will head to the polls on April 9.

The president tweeted that he gives away his entire presidential salary. Columnist EJ Montini says that 's the wrong move. Montini: Obama donated over $ 1 million to charity during his presidency. He says the real money in the Trump empire comes from commercial tenants like the Chinese bank.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied profiting from a state contract to buy submarines. Netanyahu held shares in a company that later became affiliated with the German conglomerate. He insisted he reported holding the shares, then selling them and paid the appropriate tax. Blood libel is a loaded term, as it historically refers to false accusations that Jews in the Middle Ages sacrificed Christian children.

PM says she will not stand in way of desire for new approach but DUP remains opposed to deal. Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith led a stream of Eurosceptics to support May 's deal. MPs failed to coalesce around an alternative to the deal in a series of indicative votes.

Business minister Richard Harrington resigned along with Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt , and health minister Steve Brine. In total, 29 Tory MPs broke a three-line whip demanding they oppose a plan to hold indicative votes on alternatives to her deal tomorrow. Mr Harrington warned that leaving the EU without an agreement would be a 'giant economic experiment ' that would lead to the loss of jobs and livelihoods.

This week may be the most significant since World War II, analysts say. Britain is at risk of crashing out of the European Union without a deal to soften that separation. Prime Minister Theresa May admitted today she still does n't have enough support for her version of Brexit. At this critical moment, the kingdom is deeply divided.

Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt and health minister Steve Brine resigned. Business minister Richard Harrington announced his decision to leave government on Twitter. They were among 30 members of Mrs May 's Conservative party who defied her to vote in favour of a motion giving MPs control of parliamentary business.

Jobs and wages will suffer if Britain crashes out of the European Union, the Economic and Social Research Institute ( ESRI) says. The stark warning comes as it emerged checks on some goods crossing the Border are inevitable unless the UK agrees to allow Northern Ireland to operate within EU rules. European officials are working on a system whereby trusted companies can self-declare exports to the North from April 12. But senior sources in Brussels say it will be impossible to maintain a completely open Border in the longer term unless an unprecedented deal is done.

British MPs have seized a measure of control over the stalled Brexit process from Prime Minister Theresa May 's foundering government. The House of Commons voted to give itself temporary control of the parliamentary timetable starting on Wednesday so lawmakers can vote on alternatives. The move on Monday came after May conceded that Parliament would defeat her twicerejected divorce deal with the EU again if she put it to a third vote.

MPs voted 329 to 302 for a backbench plan leading to a series of indicative votes. The result means the government is no longer even pretending to be guiding events. But one unintended consequence of Monday night's vote could be to increase the chance that - in a last gasp effort to regain control - May will play her final card.

Prime Minister Theresa May is coming under ever-increasing pressure to resign. Her approach to the endgame has prompted frustration and anger on all sides. Ministers from both the pro- and anti-Brexit camps in her cabinet have in recent weeks joined Conservative MPs in defying the government in parliamentary votes.

The Cabinet is meeting for the second time in 24 hours after the Prime Minister suffered a humiliating Commons defeat. Three pro-Remain government ministers - Alistair Burt, Richard Harrington and Steve Brine - resigned as they voted against the government. In all, 30 Conservative MPs, all Remainers, rebelled against the PM's twice-rejected deal.

Britain has just a few weeks to break its Brexit impasse. The fate of the country 's departure from the EU and that of Prime Minister Theresa May both hanging in the balance. EU leaders last week granted Britain a two-stage flextension to Brexit. If UK lawmakers approve the divorce deal agreed upon, the country will leave the EU on May 22.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected for the second time in three days a bid by gun rights activists to block his new ban. The ban is a rare recent instance of gun control at the federal level in a country that has experienced a succession of mass shootings. The policy, embraced by Trump in the wake of an October 2017 massacre in Las Vegas in which bump stocks were used, went into effect on Tuesday.

It is now illegal to own, buy , or sell a bump stock. The ban is in response to the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. Bump stock owners are asked to destroy their bump stock or turn it into an ATF office. If you are caught with one of these devices you face a $ 250,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison.

The federal ban on bump stocks went into effect on Tuesday. The devices allow semi-automatic guns to fire at a more rapid rate. Bump stocks have been banned in California for years, but the federal ban means harsher penalties. Tuesday is the deadline for owners to either destroy their device or turn it over to authorities.

The 90-day period to either destroy or turn in devices known as bump stocks is now over. Owning, buying, or selling a bump stock is now a federal crime. Offenders could face a 250,000 dollar fine and 10 years in prison. Clark Aposhian believes he may have the only legal bump stock in Utah.

The ban of bump stock devices was first announced on Dec. 18, 2018 by then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. Bump fire is the act of using the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm or revolver to fire shots in rapid succession at the cost of accuracy. Those who own bump-stock-type devices must rid themselves of them.

Bump stocks are a device that allows rifles to mimic automatic weapons. An October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 prompted action on bump stocks by President Donald Trump. In December, Justice Department officials issued the ban giving owners 90 days to either turn bump stocks over to federal agents or melt, shred or crush them.

Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has denied the first of two emergency requests to block a bump stock ban that went into effect Tuesday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor is expected to rule on a second request Tuesday. The federal ban on bump stocks takes effect more than a year after the gadget was used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

The ban of bump stock devices was first announced on Dec. 18, 2018 by then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. Bump fire is the act of using the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm or revolver to fire shots in rapid succession at the cost of accuracy. Those who own bump-stock-type devices must rid themselves of them.

Bump stocks are meant to replace the standard stock and grip of a semiautomatic rifle. They attach to a rifle 's receiver or frame. The bump-stock uses recoil effects to bounce the rifle off the shooter 's shoulder and bump the trigger back into the trigger finger. It effectively mimics fully automatic gunfire.

The Justice Department banned bump stocks in December, and on Tuesday the federal ban went into effect. The National Rifle Association announced on Thursday that it would support tighter restrictions on such devices. The bump stock is not banned under federal law even though it allows a weapon to fire at nearly the rate of a machine gun without converting it to a fully automatic firearm.

 Cyclone Idai smashed into Mozambique on March 15 unleashing hurricane-force winds and heavy rains. 90 percent of those killed by the cyclone and its aftermath had been identified and collected by their families. Stagnant water, decomposing bodies and lack of sanitation could create breeding grounds for typhus and malaria in addition to cholera, experts say.

The UN says it needs nearly $ 300m in aid over the next three months to help Mozambique 's 1.7 million cyclone victims. It is harvest season in central Mozambiques, but there are no crops left to gather. And worse , few have homes to live in.

World Health Organization is sending 900,000 oral cholera vaccines to Mozambique. More than 700 people have died in the three countries since the cyclone made landfall March 14. Doctors Without Borders and World Food Program are in Mozambiques to provide emergency aid.

People have been drinking contaminated water due to a shortage of drinking water in areas worst affected by Cyclone Idai. The UN said that there 's a joint operation with the Mozambique Health Department to stop the spread of cholera. It said that if more cases are confirmed there could be a major outbreak.



Hans-Olaf Henkel says no member of the European Parliament regrets Britain leaving. European leaders will likely decide on further postponing Brexit at an emergency summit called for April 10. Henkel added that Friday 's defeat for Theresa May 's Brexit deal raised the prospects of a second vote on leaving the EU.

UK can not betray 'increasing majority ' to remain, says Tusk. Tusk reprimanded those who voiced concerns about a potential lengthy extension to article 50 in the event of the Commons rejecting the withdrawal agreement again this week. The EU said it had completed its preparations for the UK crashing out of Europe with 'no deal ' on 12 April.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is to sacrifice her political career in a final desperate effort to get the Brexit deal through the House of Commons. Having lost control over the UK parliament and her party, Mrs May begged MPs to approve the Withdrawal Agreement in return for her resignation. But just as hope of the deal passing emerged, the DUP emphatically ruled out supporting it. And as chaos reigned in Westminster , the House Of Commons last night voted down every alternative , including a softer Brexit and no deal.

The House of Commons voted to take Brexit business into its own hands, passing by 329 to 302 an amendment by Sir Oliver Letwin. This was immediately described by Sir Bill Cash in the House as 'constitutional revolution ' Three ministers resigned so as to vote for the amendment : Alistair Burt, Richard Harrington and Steve Brine. An online petition demanding the revocation of Article 50 gained more than five million signatures.

European Council President Donald Tusk urged MEPs to act the European voice of the British people. Tusk criticised those that refuse to accept UK MEPs in the chamber after the May European elections. The European Commission 's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier responded to a question posed by firebrand pro-Brexit MEP Nigel Farage.

The clock is ticking towards 29 March and the United Kingdom 's exit from the European Union. Britain is set to endure a bout of severe economic turbulence, writes Simon Tisdall. But the real question is what Brexit means for the future of Europe, he says.

Theresa May's premiership was dominated by tortuous negotiations in Brussels and vicious infighting within her own party over the terms on which the UK would leave. She lost more than 30 ministers - most of them quitting over her Brexit plans - saw her keynote policy defeated by a record-breaking 230 votes and suffered the indignity of having her Government found in contempt of Parliament.

Theresa May is expected to bring her Withdrawal Agreement back to the House of Commons for a third vote. If it passes, this automatically triggers an extension to the process to May 22. Mrs May can be expected to make way for a new prime minister to lead those negotiations. A wide field of candidates is expected , with Boris Johnson among those thought to be mulling their prospects.

Prime Minister Theresa May pledges to step down if MPs back her EU divorce deal. Her dramatic gambit came just two hours before MPs start a flurry of votes seeking a last-minute alternative plan to replace her deal. MPs have twice resoundingly rejected the agreement May concluded with Brussels over 17 months of acrimonious talks.

It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable , called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief , they will rationalize , ignore and even deny anything that does n't fit in with thecore belief.

The new canons also stipulate that the superior of the institute must gather evidence of facts and issue a declaration, which must be confirmed, for dismissal to be legally recognised. The regulations were promulgated by publication in L'Osservatore Romano , and will go into effect on 10 April 2019.

Brunei has defended its right to implement Islamic laws that would allow death by stoning for adultery and homosexuality. Brunei, a Muslim-majority former British protectorate with a population of around 400,000, will implement the Sharia laws from April 3. Some aspects of the laws will apply to non-Muslims.

Amnesty International slams plans by Brunei to implement what the rights group called vicious Islamic criminal laws. The new penalties include stoning to death for gay sex and amputation for theft. Brunei 's sultan instituted the Sharia Penal Code in 2014 to bolster the influence of Islam in the tiny monarchy.

From April 3 in Brunei anyone found guilty of homosexuality or cheating on spouse could be whipped or stoned. The laws also introduce amputation of the hands or feet as punishment for robbery. Brunei is headed by the Sultan of Brunei and through its investment agency owns nine exclusive hotels, three of which are in the UK.

The tiny oil-rich nation of Brunei is set to institute new Sharia laws which include stoning to death homosexuals and amputations for theft. Under current law in Muslim-majority Brunei, homosexuality is punishable by up to ten years in prison. Amnesty International said the international community must urgently condemn Brunei 's move to put these cruel penalties into practice.

Brunei announced in 2013 that it was bringing in harsh Islamic laws that included punishments of death by stoning for adultery and gay sex. The move was met with international protest and some investments by the country 's sovereign wealth fund were targets of boycotts and calls for divestment. After the outcry, Brunei delayed carrying out the harshest provisions of its Shariah law. Now, it is quietly going ahead with them.

Homosexuality and adultery will be punished with death by stoning April 3 onwards. A notice on the law was posted on the Brunei attorney general 's website on December 29, 2018. A group of Muslims must be witness to the crimes in order for the offender to face punishment.

A set of archaic Sharia laws comes into effect from next week punishing adultery and homosexuality with death by lapidation in the ultra rich Sultanate of Brunei. From April 3, any individuals found guilty of the offenses will be stoned to death publicly. The execution will be witnessed by a group of Muslims as ordered in original Sharia law version.

A same-sex couple booked a trip to Brunei before the nation introduced laws to punish gay sex. The Tasmanian couple, aged 27 and 29, booked flights to London on Royal Brunei Airlines in mid-April via Webjet. The pair expressed their concerns to Webjet after the laws were announced. The 27-year-old told Webjet he felt uncomfortable talking to a Bruneian airline representative and was advised the pair could cancel their flights for $ 2,200. The couple requested to speak with another representative after one claimed the previous adviser sounded 'annoyed ' and was unaware of the new laws. The second representative said 'If you act heterosexual you should be fine . '

Brunei recently announced some strict laws which have been gradually rolled out in the last five years. A local penal code demands that any individual found guilty is stoned to death and the punishment will be witnessed by a group of Muslims. Amnesty International has criticised the country over the new laws, which it deems as a clear violation of human rights.

During his presidency, Barack Obama brought in a ban on offshore drilling in parts of the Arctic and Atlantic. Mr Trump attempted to overturn this with an executive order in 2017, promising to allow oil and gas companies back into protected regions. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason has now ruled that the president violated a federal environmental law.

A federal judge ruled that an executive order by Mr. Trump that lifted an Obama-era ban on oil and gas drilling was unlawful. The decision immediately reinstates the drilling ban on most of the Arctic Ocean off the coast of Alaska. It also blocks drilling around a series of coral canyons that run from Norfolk to the Canadian border.

A federal judge in Alaska has overturned U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to open vast areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil and gas leasing. The decision leaves intact President Barack Obama's policies putting the Arctic's Chukchi Sea and part of the Beaufort Sea off-limits to oil leasing. Trump's move to put offshore Arctic, Atlantic areas back into play for oil development came in a 2017 executive order.

Trump's move to put offshore Arctic andAtlantic areas back into play for oil development came in a 2017 executive order.

The decision leaves intact President Barack Obama 's policies putting the Arctic 's Chukchi Sea and part of the Beaufort Sea off-limits to oil leasing. Trump's attempt to undo Obama's protections was unlawful and a violation of the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the judge said.

A federal judge in Alaska late Friday declared President Trump 's order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean illegal. The decision puts 128 million acres of federal waters off limits to energy exploration. The judge also blocked a land swap the Interior Department arranged that would pave the way for road through wilderness in a major national wildlife refuge in Alaska.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians have demonstrated in Gaza to mark the anniversary of the start of weekly protests on the boundary with Israel. Demonstrators threw stones and burned tyres, with Israeli troops using tear-gas and live rounds in response. The protests back the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to ancestral homes in what is now Israel. At least 189 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed between March and December 2018, UN says. A UN inquiry says Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes during the protest marches - a charge Israel rejects.

Israeli forces have killed four Palestinian protesters as demonstrations take place on the Gaza border. The marches are calling for an end to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, which was imposed when Hamas took over Gaza by force in 2007. The Israeli army says 40,000 Palestinians have gathered for the protest. Dozens are reported to have approached the fence, unfurling Palestinian flags and throwing rocks and explosives towards Israeli troops. The soldiers reportedly responded with tear gas and live fire.

Ezzedine al-Baz has had five operations on his leg since being shot a year ago. He is missing a chunk of bone, his leg remains strapped in a metal case and he will likely never walk as before.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is prepared to wage a broad military campaign in Gaza if needed. Israel launched air strikes and moved troops and armour reinforcements to the Gaza border this week after a rocket attack from the Hamas-run enclave wounded seven Israelis on Monday. In Gaza, organisers announced plans for a massive protest on Saturday along the border to mark the anniversary of weekly demonstrations at which Israeli forces have killed nearly 200 Palestinians.

One year ago, Palestinians trapped in Gaza began a protest movement at the frontier with Israel that was intended to last six weeks. Men, women and children demanded recognition of the right of Palestinian refugees in Gaza and elsewhere to return to their ancestral homes in Israel. They also demanded an end to a punishing blockade that has made life unliveable. Almost 29,000 Palestinians have been injured since the protests began and more than 190 killed.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians are expected to gather Saturday for the first anniversary of the often violent protests along the border. Egypt , the United Nations and others have been trying to mediate an agreement to limit the level of violence. Hamas-backed attacks in the Israeli-occupied West Bank would also cease.

Night-time protests have become a new phenomenon on the Gaza-Israel border. Organizers say the intention of the events is to fray the nerves of Israeli military lookouts. Israeli troops have killed nearly 200 Palestinians at the weekly border protests. The protests began on March 30 last year and have wounded thousands more.

Algeria 's army chief renewed a call for President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to be declared unfit for office. Move follows weeks of protests demanding an end to the ailing leader 's 20-year rule. Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah made proposal on Tuesday. He said most people supported the army's plan but some were resisting.

Thousands of Algerians gathered for new anti-government protests in the capital on Friday despite moves by veteran loyalists to abandon ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Turnout was widely seen as a key test of the public mood after a succession of longtime loyalists deserted the president and called for him to step down. Activists angrily rejected the moves as a desperate bid by key figures in the president's entourage to salvage their grip on power and demanded that they too quit.

Thousands of Algerians gathered for new anti-government protests in the capital on Friday despite moves by a succession of veteran loyalists to abandon ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Demonstrations were expected to take place across the North African country where protests broke out more than a month ago. Turnout was widely seen as a key test of the public mood after longtime loyalists deserted the president and called for him to step down to make way for a government-led change of leadership. Activists angrily rejected the moves as a desperate bid to salvage their grip on power and demanded that they too quit.

Algerian police used tear gas and water cannon on Friday to try to disperse hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. The protesters are demanding the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The army chief of staff on Tuesday asked the constitutional council to rule whether the ailing 82-year-old president is fit for office. The protests have been largely peaceful but have put pressure on the military.

Algerian Army Chief of Staff Ahmed Gaid Salah told cadets during a nationally televised speech that ailing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika should be declared incapacitated. He said this is in order to find a peaceful solution to the current political crisis. Under article 102 of the constitution, the head of parliament would take over as acting head of state for 45 days. The Constitutional Council would then rule on the president 's inability to govern, granting a further 45 days as acting president to the parliament speaker.

Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been confined to a wheelchair since a 2013 stroke. The country 's ruling party and top labor union joined cascading calls for the ailing 82-year-old leader to resign. The head of Algeria 's powerful armed forces demanded that a constitutional process be set in motion. The military is again in the spotlight during this current popular uprising in vast oil-rich Algeria.

Thousands of protesters gathered on Friday for the sixth consecutive mass anti-government protest throughout various Algerian cities. Protesters are demanding that the government implements Article 7 of the national constitution. Earlier in the week, the Algerian Army senior officer Gen. Ahmed Gaid Salah called on the government to implement Article 102.

Anti-government protesters throng the streets of Algeria 's capital Algiers Friday. About one million people took to the streets to demand the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Rallies were expected to take place across the North African country, where protests broke out more than a month ago.

Protesters gathered in Algiers for the sixth weekly protest against president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Police officers at the scene put the number of protesters at about 1 million, the largest number since the protests began last month. The latest rally comes after several key allies publicly deserted the 83-year-old president. The protests were triggered by his decision to run for a fifth term.



The Dutch government says it expects to stop extracting gas from a vast underground field in the country 's north by mid-2022. The move would end decades of extracting the gas from the field. The gas has been extracted from the area since the 1970s and 1980s. The field is located in the Netherlands' north.

Three teenage migrants have been charged in a court in Malta with hijacking a small commercial oil tanker. The act is considered a terrorist crime under Maltese law. The suspects pleaded not guilty during an arraignment in Valletta, the Maltese capital. The captain said rescued migrants had begun to riot and threaten violence.

Nader el-Hiblu, the 42-year-old Libyan captain of the El Hiblu 1 ship, said he and five other crew members feared they could be killed. He said the threats by rioting migrants forced him to agree to their demand that he take them to Europe, not back to Libya. The migrants revolted against heading back to lawless Libya, where aid groups say migrants are beaten and tortured.

The Turkish oil tanker El Hiblu 1 was escorted to Malta Thursday after armed forces restored control to the captain. Maltese armed military personnel stood guard on the ship 's deck, and a dozen or so migrants were also visible. Several police vans were lined up on shore to take custody of the migrants for investigation.

Three teenage migrants are charged in a Maltese court with hijacking a small commercial tanker. The three are among 108 Africans rescued by the El Hiblu 1 tanker this week. They are accused of threatening the crew on Wednesday to try to force the boat to go to Malta and not take them back to Libya.

Arab leaders say they will seek a U.N. Security Council resolution against the U.S. decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Arab leaders also ended their annual summit in Tunisia calling for cooperation with non-Arab Iran based on non-interference in each others ' affairs. The abrupt departure from the summit shortly after it began by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani suggested rivalries were not easily buried.

30th Arab League summit kicked off in Tunisia on Sunday against backdrop of ongoing conflicts, serious divisions and unrest. Leaders issued renewed call for establishment of Palestinian state and condemned U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over occupied Golan Heights. But expectations for any concrete action were low, partly due to close ties regional powerhouses such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have cultivated with the Trump administration.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs participated in the Preparatory Meeting ahead of the 30th Arab Summit. The meeting discussed several of the issues tabled for discussion on the Arab Summit agenda. The Summit is due to kick off in the Republic of Tunisia on Sunday 31 March 2019.

Tunisia will coordinate with fellow Arab countries to contain any fallout from the U.S. decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, Foreign Minister Khemaies Jhinaoui said on Friday. He was speaking to a meeting of Arab ministers ahead of the annual Arab League summit. The meeting is likely to focus on Washington 's decision and its move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel 's capital.

Gulf states likely to tone down any statement of condemnation of Israeli control of Golan Heights and Jerusalem. Affirming international consensus that Golan is occupied Syrian land would further highlight Syria's absence from Arab League. Some Arab leaders think Syria - a founding member - should be readmitted. Others, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have spent years supporting the insurgency.

Syrian state-owned media reported that Israel had launched air strikes against the Syrian city of Aleppo. Tel Aviv neither confirmed nor denied the claim. Ghassan Kadi, a political analyst of Syrian origin, shared his views on what was behind the reported Israeli attack. He suggested that Israel 's main objective in the Aleppo airstrike is to demonstrate to the regional players that Israel is still capable of launching such attacks.

Donald Trump has recognized Israel's claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Peter Bergen: This support of Netanyahu and capitulation to the Israeli far right comes at the expense of thousands of Syrian and millions of Palestinian lives. He says the U.S. must be prepared to present a robust Middle East policy in 2020 elections.

The US State Department says the administration is preparing to redraw all government maps of Israel and the surrounding region to include the Golan Heights as a part of Israel. So far, no official US map of the region published online has been altered in accordance to US President Donald Trump 's recent proclamation. The new maps will be consistent with the recent change in US policy, a State Department spokesperson said.

Land Day is an integral part of the political life and struggles of the oppressed Palestinian people. It has been shaped and has persisted in protest against violence, racial discrimination, confiscation of lands, destruction of villages and displacement of Palestinians. The acts of the President of the United States over the past year to recognize Jerusalem al-Quds as the capital of the Zionist regime are in contradiction of international laws and principles.

Many of the estimated 25,000 Israeli Jews who settled in the Golan Heights concur that the lush hills, tented date farms and sizable agricultural production here is better off in Israeli hands. The Golan 's Druze residents were living in Syria when Israel invaded and captured the region during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel views the region - often used as a launching pad for rockets - as vital to its security.



Taiwan condemned what it called a provocative move by China after two Chinese fighter jets crossed a maritime border. Taiwan scrambled aircraft to drive away the two Chinese planes, the self-ruled island 's defence ministry said. There was no immediate reaction from Beijing, which views Taiwan as a renegade Chinese province.

Taipei hit out at China for what it said was a reckless and provocative incursion by two fighter jets across a largely respected line dividing the two sides in the Taiwan Strait. China has ramped up the number of fighter and warship crossings near Taiwan or through the straits in recent years. But it is highly unusual for them to cross the so-called median line , a widely agreed upon boundary that passes through the middle of the strait.

Taiwan says Chinese warplanes crossed into its airspace and that it had scrambled fighters in response. The 180-km-wide Taiwan Strait separates mainland China from self-governed and democratic Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province that must be brought back into the fold - by force if necessary.

The talks planned for September in Taipei will include a senior official from Washington. The U.S. has formal diplomatic relations with China but maintains strong ties with Taiwan. China insists that Taiwan is its territory to be brought under its control by force. More than 70 percent of Taiwanese oppose China 's goal of unification.

China continues to provide huge infrastructure financing as part of its One Belt One Road scheme. China is also hoping to overcome opposition claims to the strategically and historically important South China Sea. The country has laid claim to much of the area which contains enormous reserves of oil and gas but also possesses key strategic importance for the region. China 's approach has been to provide financing in many ASEAN countries in order to split opposition to its moves in the area.

Taiwan has sought F-16s for more than a decade to defend against China. Sale would signal a new American willingness to back the democratically run island. China has directed its industrial strength toward huge investments in military hardware. The sale could be calibrated to test China 's bottom line without open conflict.

The U.S. may finally sell Taiwan the warplanes it has sought for more than a decade. Taipei 's request to buy more than 60 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16s would signal a new American willingness to back the democratically run island. China has directed its industrial strength toward huge investments in military hardware over the past two decades.

Two Chinese fighter jets flew past a maritime line amid growing friction between Taipei and Beijing. China has repeatedly sent military aircraft and ships to circle Taiwan during drills. Taiwan is one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship. The United States last week sent Navy and Coast Guard ships through Taiwan Strait.

Ukrainians are voting in the first round of presidential elections. Current leader Petro Poroshenko is seeking re-election but the surprise front-runner is 41-year-old comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Both Mr Poroshenko and former PM Yulia Tymoshenko have expressed largely pro-EU views. None of the pro-Russian candidates are seen as serious contenders.

Ukraine 's Election Will Test the Strength of Its Democracy on Sunday. This election is n't just about who will be the next president of Ukraine.

The new era will start on May 1, when Crown Prince Naruhito ascends to the Chrysanthemum Throne. This is said to be the first time that the characters chosen were drawn from Japanese classical literature. The poem from which they are taken describes an ume Japanese apricot flower in full bloom in early spring after surviving a cold winter.

It might be 2019 in much of the world , but in Japan it is Heisei 31 , or the 31st year of Emperor Akihito 's reign. Japan is the only country in the world still using Chinese-style imperial calendars. New era name will be announced at 11:30 a.m. on Monday -- a month ahead of the ceremony.

Japan has been set abuzz guessing Japan 's 248th gengo , or era name. Shopping malls, retail outlets and even onsen hot spring resorts running campaigns. A select committee of nine panellists will make the decision on Monday ( April 1 ) morning.

Nostalgia , excitement as Japan awaits new imperial era name. New name will follow Emperor Naruhito , after his May 1 investiture , for the duration of his rule. An era name is an inextricable part of public life and shared memory in Japan.

An era name is an inextricable part of public life and shared memory in Japan. A lot of what happens in the years to come - births, deaths, natural disasters, cultural and social phenomena - will be connected to the era name. As such, the closing days of the current Heisei era have inspired a collective bout of nostalgia.

The new name will follow Emperor Naruhito after his May 1 investiture. A top-secret committee has been poring over ancient documents to find the perfect - and perfectly uncontroversial - two Chinese characters to describe the next several decades. What they settle on will affect everything from calendars to train tickets to computer software to government documents.

British lawmakers have once again failed to find a majority for any proposal in votes on alternatives to the government 's rejected Brexit deal. The options included remaining in a customs union with the EU - which failed by just three votes - and holding a new referendum on Britain 's membership in the bloc. Three days after the date on which Britain was originally due to leave the EU , it was still uncertain how.

The PM acknowledged as much when addressing the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs this week. She also spoke of the opportunity to embark on a new chapter. We should acknowledge that phase two of Brexit will not automatically yield bandwidth for other critical matters of state. We need to raise our eyes up and look outwardly.

Representatives from industry and the world of work came into parliament to tell MPs to stop messing about and find a way forward. They told us that workers and business alike are looking to MPs to deliver an answer. We were told about how British savers have taken £19bn out of the UK 's equity funds since the 2016 referendum.

The British people must make a decision before April 12 on how to proceed, Maas says. The EU has made provisions to shield citizens from the negative impact of a hard Brexit, he says. Maas: "We are running out of time to prevent a disorderly Brexit"

Nearly three years after the divisive referendum that saw 52 % of voters back leaving the EU, Britain 's MPs are at a loss on how the UK can properly leave the bloc.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel this week.

The UK is set to crash out of the UK on April 12 , with European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee admitting Ireland will be left in a difficult position.

Nicola Sturgeon has quietly become the darling of the Remain movement. Her 62-38 per cent Euro referendum vote in Scotland gives her a clear mandate. But the SNP 's conduct was no less shabby than that of any other Parliamentary group. Ken Clarke 's amendment to guarantee Britain remained inside the Customs Union would have more or less killed a hard Brexit stone dead.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and her cabinet are looking for ways to bring her EU withdrawal agreement back to the House of Commons for a fourth attempt at winning MPs ' backing. MPs on Friday rejected May 's agreement for the third time by 344 votes to 286. MPs from all parties will now test support for other options during a second round of indicative votes in April.

At least six EU-supporters in Mrs May 's Cabinet of senior ministers will resign if a no-deal Brexit gets the go-ahead. It comes as Brexiteer Esther McVey said she will enter into the running for the Prime Minister 's job if she has a fair shot.

Britain may be forced to create a national unity government to end the impasse over Britain leaving the EU. Former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan 's comments came a day after the House of Commons rebuffed the prime minister 's call for lawmakers to put aside self and party. May 's government is considering a fourth vote on her deal, bolstered by their success in narrowing her margin of defeat.



Former foreign minister was sworn in at a special sitting of Parliament. He took over from his former Cabinet colleague Marie-Lousie Coleiro Preca. Dr Vella said he was assuming the office with deep humility, gratitude and pride. He said he had accepted the role of President in order to serve the people.

Russia dispatched military aid to Venezuela over the weekend, sending two planes full of unspecified wares and accompanied by roughly 100 troops. A diplomatic source from Caracas told Sputnik that the visit was planned far in advance and is in no way connected to the threat of a foreign military invasion of the country. The Mainstream Media wants to promote the narrative of a Russian military intervention in Venezuela in order to fearmonger about Moscow 's global intentions and justify more robust US action there.

A military helicopter training facility was revealed in Venezuela Friday. The announcement came several days after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced the build-up of Russian troops and equipment in the country. The Trump administration condemned President Maduro for what it said was his cozy relationship with Moscow. Russia responded over the weekend by indicating it had sent military personnel to the Latin American country.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is a pariah in the eyes of much of the Western hemisphere.

The Wall Street Journal declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin had pulled a Syria in Venezuela.

The move by the government-backed National Constituent Assembly on Tuesday paves the way for Guaido 's prosecution and possibly his arrest. It is unclear whether Maduro will actively threaten Guaido.

Zeese said that one of the delegates who remains in the Latin American country is not aware of any manifestation of support to self-proclaimed President Juan Guaidó.

The PM says she wants to meet Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a plan on the future relationship with the EU. But she insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. The cross-party talks offer has angered Tory Brexiteers, with Boris Johnson accusing ministers of entrusting the final handling of Brexit to Labour.

Prime Minister Theresa May had one final thing to offer : herself. After months of trying and failing to pass a deal on Britain 's withdrawal from the European Union, the UK is set to leave the EU. The Daily podcast is CNN.com's daily look at the biggest stories in the news.

Corbyn also expressed sympathy '' with the hunger strikers which protesting the imprisonment of PKK ringleader Abdullah ÖCalan.

MPs are no closer to agreeing on a Brexit deal. If MPs do n't pick a deal by April 12 then the UK could leave the EU without one. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are the bookies favourites to replace Theresa May. Jeremy Corbyn is still in the running as is Sajid Javid but his odds have lengthened.

There is also the prospect of a snap General Election being called in a final bid for unity in the Commons.

EU-27 willing to accept a Customs Union, Norway-style relationship or a second referendum on EU membership but there is no room to amend May 's Withdrawal Agreement.

The Central Election Commission of Ukraine processed 99.99 % of voting protocols in electronic format in Ukraine 's presidential elections. Volodymyr Zelensky and incumbent Head of State Petro Poroshenko make it to the runoff. According to the latest data , a total of 18,893,393 people voted in the elections in Ukraine.

 exit polls show Volodymyr Zelensky with 30.4 percent of the vote. A run-off is scheduled for April 21. Zelenski portrays a history teacher turned president in his hit television show. He has not mentioned his Jewish identity in interviews before or during the campaign.

Vasyl Holoborodko is the incorruptible television president Zelensky plays in the hit series Servant of the People. In the third season, crazed Ukrainian nationalists stage a coup that leads to his arrest. Fortunately for Ukraine, he stages a comeback, is re-elected president and appoints a new cabinet of reformers.

41-year-old Volodymyr Zelenskiy held a comfortable lead over incumbent President Petro Poroshenko. The comedian with no political experience raced ahead in the first round of Ukraine 's presidential election. The vote was deemed largely free and fair by the national electoral commission. A crowded field of 39 candidates has now shrunk to just two , with Mr Zelensky and Mr Poroshenko set to go head-to-head in a second round run-off on April 21.

Ukrainian elections are in full farce mode, with a comedian - Volodymyr Zelenskiy - who plays the president on TV leading in the polls. Current president Petro Poroshenko is in a distant second with just 17.8 %. The average monthly salary in Ukraine in September 2018 was 9,042 hryvnia ( about $ 320 )

Ukrainians will choose from among 39 candidates for a president who can guide the country of more than 42 million out of troubles. President Petro Poroshenko, who was elected three months after those protests, is running for another term. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who shot to national prominence by playing the role of president in a television comedy series, topped the poll at 20.9 percent. Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister making her third run at the presidency, was in third with 9.7 percent.

Early benefits in Ukraine 's presidential election revealed a comic with no political experience using a large lead over 38 rivals but far from a first-round victory. The strong showing of Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Sunday 's voting appeared to reflect Ukrainians ' desire for new blood within a political system awash in corruption. The election had been shadowed by allegations of widespread vote buying.

Ukraine is a Nazi-infested police state , a fantasy democracy , not the real thing. In February 2014, democratic governance was abolished , resistance against repressive ruling authorities not tolerated. On Sunday, round one of the farcical presidential election was held, 39 candidates on the ballot. Three alone mattered - US-installed billionaire/oligarch incumbent Petro Poroshenko, convicted felon Yulia Timoshenko, and comedian/entertainer Vladimir Zelensky.

The Commerce Department said Friday that the weak gain in consumer spending followed a 0.6 percent plunge in December. Many analysts believe the economy has entered a soft patch and that growth is significantly slower in the current quarter. President Donald Trump, who is counting on a strong economy to support his re-election bid, has disputed talk of a slowdown.

Yulia Tymoshenko said at a news conference on Tuesday that President Petro Poroshenko falsified the vote in his favor. She said she will not contest the results as she believes the courts are also controlled by the president. With nearly 99 percent of the vote counted, comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy leads the race with 30 percent.



Senate Republicans voted 51-48 on Wednesday to approve new rules to limit debate time for most of President Trump's nominees. The new rule is designed to confirm Trump 's nominees at a much faster pace. It affects nominations for Cabinet officials , circuit court judges and Supreme Court picks.

Senate Democrats have pushed through a reform of the filibuster-at least as it concerns presidential appointments to the executive branch and the judiciary. Republicans are scrambling for a response. Their political message has essentially consisted of accusing Democrats of an undemocratic power play. This seems like an odd strategy because no one outside of Washington follows the ins and outs of Senate procedure.

Chuck Schumer: Mitch McConnell's op-ed about obstruction is a joke. Schumer: GOP has been driven farther and farther toward the extreme right for 40 years. He says GOP has used the courts as a way to achieve its policy goals. Schumer says McConnell's "conveyor belt" of nominees is one of his proudest achievements.

Trump tweets that Republicans will vote on a new healthcare plan after 2020 elections. The comment comes as the Trump administration has shifted its focus back to healthcare.

House Democrats have sent their long-anticipated request for six years of President Donald Trump 's tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service. The request is the opening salvo in what could prove an explosive battle between Democrats and the Trump administration over the president 's personal finances that is expected to wind up in the courts. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., requested six years' worth of tax information from 2013-2018. Neal said that the decision to request the returns was in the interest of ensuring trust in our democracy.

The Center for American Progress is trying to increase the pressure on Democrats to get Trump 's tax returns. A new memo argues getting the returns is a legal slam dunk, and is absolutely justifiable, or even imperative, as a matter of oversight and good governance.

Eastern Libyan military forces have moved to western Libya and were briefly locked in a skirmish with a rival force south of the capital Tripoli. The advance took diplomats and analysts by surprise, exploiting their focus on neighboring Algeria where President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned on Tuesday. Libya - in trouble since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 - is divided between the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and a parallel administration.

Libya 's internationally recognised government in Tripoli has declared a military alert. The alert comes after eastern forces loyal to renegade General Khalifa Haftar said they had moved towards the western part of the country. A brief skirmish was reported on Wednesday evening near a town south of the capital. No casualty figures or details were immediately available.

Libya is torn between a UN-backed government based in Tripoli and an alternative administration and institutions in the east.

The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to authorize the issuance of a subpoena for Robert Mueller 's full and unredacted report. The move is one step closer to forcing Attorney General William Barr to turn over the roughly 400-page report. Nadler has said he plans to publicly release the documents with redactions later this month. The Democrat-led committee also approved subpoenas for five of President Trump 's former top advisers.

The House Oversight and Judiciary committees announced Monday that they are preparing subpoenas on Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's report on Russian collusion in the 2016 election. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who chairs the Judiciary committee, said Monday that his committee would mark up a subpoena on April 3 to obtain the full Mueller report. Nadler also said his committee will vote to authorize subpoenas for Don McGahn, former White House Counsel; Steve Bannon, ex-White House Chief Strategist; Hope Hicks, former communications director; Reince Priebus, former chief of staff; and Ann Donaldson, former deputy counsel.

The exact timing of special counsel Robert Mueller 's endgame is unclear. Justice Department regulations require only that Mueller give the attorney general a confidential report. It could be as simple as a bullet point list or as fulsome as a report running hundreds of pages. It 's not clear whether the president 's lawyers will get an advance look at Mueller's conclusions.

The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether to subpoena the full Mueller report and all of its underlying documents. House Democrats had set a Tuesday deadline for Attorney General William Barr to provide the report to Congress. Barr responded to the demand on Friday , telling lawmakers that he plans to send a version of the Mueller report to lawmakers in mid-April.

Officials investigating the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX crash believe that a new automated stall-prevention system was activated before the plane dived into the ground. The automated system is known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. Boeing met with top airline industry personnel and reporters just earlier this week to demonstrate proposed software updates.

The crash killed all 157 people on board and led to a global grounding of 737 MAX jets. Boeing had issued guidelines to pilots about shutting off an automated anti-stall system in the wake of a deadly crash in Indonesia less than five months earlier. A preliminary report into the crash has not yet been released by Ethiopian investigators.

Between 25 and 50 percent of known white dwarfs show signs of having consumed planetary material in their past. The solar system is likely harboring its own piece of a planetary core - 16 Psyche - which is ripe for exploration. At 125 miles wide and composed of up to 95 percent metal, Psyche offers a unique natural laboratory.

Astronomers from University of Warwick in Coventry, England, said on April 4 that they 've detected a relatively large fragment from a former planet. The fragment is orbiting in a disk of debris encircling a dead star - a white dwarf. The white dwarf should have destroyed its solar system in a system-wide cataclysm that followed its death. But the newly discovered planet fragment is thought to be rich in heavy metals - iron and nickel - which helped it survive destruction. And they said this system offers us a hint as to the future of our own solar system - 6 billion years from now.

University of Warwick-led team reports the tentative identification of a massive chunk of debris orbiting the white dwarf SDSS J122859.93+104032.9. If suspicions are correct, it could be a 125-mile round fragment of an Earth-like planetary core. The exposed core may be protected by a dust ring around it.

For the first time, a small planet has been confirmed orbiting a white dwarf star. White dwarfs represent the end of the line for main-sequence stars such as the sun. A typical white dwarf has a mass equivalent to that of the sun but is only about the size of the Earth. Astronomers have long theorised that it was possible for planets to survive the explosive degeneration of a main- sequence star into a dwarf.

Scientists have spotted the possible core remnant of a planet orbiting the white dwarf SDSSJ122859.93+104032.9. The body completed one passage around its host star in just over two hours, orbiting at a distance that is smaller than the radius of the sun in a disc of gas and dust. The discovery is surprising, as we did n't think anything could survive so close to a white dwarf.

Scientists say they have detected the suspected remnant of a white dwarf world. The first-of-its-kind discovery could offer fascinating insights into planetary systems. It 's like the iron core left behind by a larger body that 's been ripped apart,' says Christopher Manser of the University of Warwick.

Japan 's space agency said an explosive dropped Friday from its Hayabusa2 spacecraft successfully blasted the surface of an asteroid for the first time. Scientists hope the samples will help them understand the history of the solar system. The asteroid, named Ryugu after an undersea palace in a Japanese folktale, is about 300 million kilometers from Earth.

The Small Carry-on Impactor experiment-SCI for short-is to learn more about how asteroids like Ryugu change over time. Scientists are n't quite sure how big the crater will be. They can only aim SCI to a certain degree ; the target spot has a margin of error of 200 meters. The crater depth is expected to be about a tenth of its diameter.

A Japanese probe began descending towards an asteroid on Thursday on a mission to blast a crater into its surface. The mission will be the latest in a series of explorations carried out by the Japanese space agency 's Hayabusa2 probe and could reveal more about the origin of life on Earth. The task scheduled for Friday is the riskiest yet and involves the release of a device filled with explosives. It will take two weeks for the probe itself to return to its position near Ryugu after the detonation and impact.

Hayabusa 2 will drop an impactor the size of a baseball weighing 2 kilograms ( 4.4 pounds ) on the asteroid on April 5. It will create a crater of up to 10 meters ( 32 feet ) in diameter with a depth of 1 meter ( 3.3 feet ) if the underground structure is soft. The spacecraft is to wait a few weeks before returning to the area above the crater for observations.

Hayabusa2 probe began descending towards asteroid Ryugu on Thursday. Japanese probe will blast a crater into the surface of the asteroid on Friday. The aim is to collect material that could shed light on the early days of the solar system. It is unclear when the first confirmation of the mission 's success will come.

Ecuador twists embarrassing INA Papers into pretext to oust Assange ( en Español ) On 26 March, WikiLeaks ' Twitter account announced that President Moreno is being investigated by Ecuador 's Congress for corruption. The same tweet referenced President Moreno 's attempt to surrender Assange in exchange for US debt relief , a fact that had been reported by The New York Times.

Ecuador is preparing to expel WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from its embassy in London. Assange has been holed up in the embassy since 2012 to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden on allegations of rape. The INA papers are a collection of documents leaked to an Ecuadorian legislator which have implicated President Lenin Moreno in a corruption scandal.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange remains an evasive and polarising figure. The 47-year-old Australian won fame as the frontman of the whistleblowing website. He took political refuge in Ecuador 's embassy in London in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden. He was arrested in Britain in 2010 on allegations of sexual assault and rape in Sweden.

Ecuador 's insistence on conditioning Julian Assange 's stay in its London abode is tantamount to corroding the idea of asylum to vacuity. Assange has ventured to test the onerous limits on his conduct that have been imposed by embassy protocols. The Ecuadorean response was a crowing one, arguing that the state 's treatment of Assange was in accordance with international law.

Ecuador's government has accused WikiLeaks of having leaked communications and images of President Moreno 's family circle. Not a single document referring to INA PAPERS , or the president's family, has ever been leaked or published by WikiLeaks. Despite being an outrageous accusation , the farce has reached the point that the Ecuadorian National Assembly has issued a resolution to investigate Julian Assange.

Julian Assange is to be 'kicked out of the Ecuadorian embassy within hours and arrested ' claim Wikileaks. Assange has been in the embassy since 2012 after Swedish authorities announced they wished to interview him in connection with a rape allegation. More to follow. Click here for more on this story.

Julian Assange is set to be expelled from Ecuadorian embassy. WikiLeaks founder has been in the London building since 2012 after seeking asylum there as Swedish police wanted to question him over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Mr Assange is wanted by American authorities for his role in publishing secret US documents. Ecuador 's president said Mr Assange had repeatedly violated some of the conditions of his asylum.

The complaint follows legislative attempts to block Trump from diverting billions of dollars toward one of his keystone campaign promises.

Online Harms White Paper is a joint proposal from the DCMS and the Home Office. The plans call for an independent regulator to hold internet companies to account. The regulator will define a code of best practice that social networks and internet companies must adhere to. The rules would apply to Facebook , Twitter and Google as well as messaging services such as Snapchat and cloud storage services.

The duty of care will require firms to take more responsibility for the safety of users and more actively tackle the harm caused by content or activity on their platforms. The regulator will have the power to issue substantial fines , block access to sites and potentially impose liability on individual members of senior management.

The United States has designated Iran 's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization. The move makes it illegal for any organization to provide material support to the IRGC. The designation marks the first time that the U.S. has said a part of another government is a terrorist organization, the White House says.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was set to receive the 2019 Foley American Hostage Freedom Award. Peter Bergen says the award was mysteriously rescinded and Pompeo disinvited.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was set to receive the 2019 Foley American Hostage Freedom Award. But at the last minute, the award was mysteriously rescinded and Pompeo disinvited. The award is named for James Foley, the American journalist who was kidnapped and beheaded by the Islamic State.

Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Iranian Parliament, said on Sunday that a bill had been prepared to designate US military forces as terrorists. Earlier, he pledged that if the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) are blacklisted by the US as a terrorist group, Tehran would respond in kind. The Wall Street Journal reported that Washington may blacklist the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organisation. The decision is expected to be announced on 8 April and if taken, it would be the first time the US has officially blacklisted another county 's military as terrorist.

Iran will take reciprocal action against the United States if Washington designates the elite Revolutionary Guards as terrorists. The U.S. is expected to designate the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization. It is the first time Washington has formally labeled another country´s military a terrorist group. The move has been rumored for years.

The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation said it canceled plans to present Pompeo with its hostage freedom award. The foundation says it changed its plans because the administration did not press for genuine accountability from the Saudi government for the slaying of Jamal Khashoggi. The award would have conflicted with a core mission of the organization : promoting the safety of journalists.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to re-election on Wednesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump phoned to congratulate him on his re- election, Netanyahu said.

The last polls were published on Friday, the last day to do so by law. Exit polling will begin at 10 p.m. Israel time on Tuesday night. A party must garner at least 3.25 percent of the total vote to enter the Knesset.

Scientists will gather in six simultaneous press briefings around the world to unveil the result. The U.S. press briefing will be held at 9 a.m. Eastern at the National Press Club in Washington. Black holes are super-dense remnants of collapsed stars whose gravitational forces are so intense that not even light can escape.

On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration will release their first-ever image of such an event horizon. Black holes are predicted by both Newton 's and Einstein 's theories of gravity. The size of the predicted event horizon is set by the mass of the black hole and the speed of light. If light moved infinitely fast , there would be no event horizon at all.

U.S. National Science Foundation has scheduled a news conference in Washington to announce a groundbreaking result from the Event Horizon Telescope project. Simultaneous news conferences are scheduled in Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo. A black hole 's event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything - stars, planets, gas, dust - gets sucked in irretrievably.

Astronomers at ESO are set to make a mysterious major announcement about a black hole discovery. The announcement will be made at 2pm UTC tomorrow ( 10 April) This will surely lead to the reveal of only one thing : our very first clear image of the event horizon of a black Hole.

The monumental black hole picture will be shared with the public from six different locations around the globe on Wednesday , April 10. The announcements will simultaneously kick off at precisely 2pm UK time ( 1pm UTC or 9am EDT ) in each location. You can watch the press conferences live online in a multitude of languages , inducing English, Japanese and Mandarin.

Astronomers are poised Wednesday to unveil the first direct image of a black hole. The picture will have been captured by the Event Horizon Telescope ( EHT) The EHT is a network of eight radio telescopes scattered across the globe. The data is recorded with very high accuracy, put onto hard disks and shipped to a central location.

Chinese scientists helped create the breakthrough image of a black hole by capturing the last glimmerings of energy falling into it. The image was taken by using a camera attached to a telescope. The black hole is believed to be the largest in the world. It is thought to have a mass of more than 1.5 billion billion tonnes.

Astronomers are expected to unveil their long-awaited pictures of two black holes. One of the objects sits at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The other is in the heart of Messier 87, a giant galaxy in the constellation Virgo. If all has gone well, either or both of the black holes should appear as a tiny shadow.

Astronomers are poised Wednesday to unveil the first direct image of a black hole and the surrounding whirlwind of white-hot gas and plasma. The picture will have been captured by the Event Horizon Telescope ( EHT ) , a network of eight radio telescopes scattered across the globe. Paul McNamara, an astrophysicist at the European Space Agency and project scientist for the LISA mission that will track massive black hole mergers from space, helped AFP put the image into context.

Libya 's Parliament speaker in the east says no peace deal can be reached right now. Aguila Saleh says the self-styled Libyan National Army has stepped in to liberate Tripoli. He says it would be impossible to hold next week 's U.N.-planned peace conference. LNA forces launched a major military offensive earlier this month aimed at capturing Tripoli.

The United Nations strongly condemned an escalation of violence in Libya on Monday. It urged for fighting to stop following an airstrike east of the capital Tripoli. An airstrike at the airport outside of Tripoli shut down the capital 's only functioning airport. The attack was claimed by Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar and his LNA.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for an immediate halt to military operations in Libya. Fighting displaced thousands of people and Tripoli 's only functioning airport was attacked. The fighting threatens to disrupt oil supplies, prompt migration to Europe and wreck UN plans for an election to end rivalries between parallel administrations.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called for an immediate halt to the fighting and called for talks. Rebel forces under Gen Khalifa Haftar have advanced from the east with the aim of taking Tripoli. Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj has accused him of attempting a coup and says rebels will be met with force.

Khalifa Haftar is the face of the eastern Libyan government. He took part in the coup that brought Muammar Gaddafi to power in 1969. In 1980 he was sent to fight in Chad where he was captured by Chadians in 1987. The commander defected from the Libyan army upon his release. He formed the military wing for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya to overthrow Gaddafi.

Khalifa Haftar pushed on with his assault on Tripoli on Monday, defying international calls for a ceasefire days into a battle that has left dozens dead. At least 35 people have been killed in fighting sinceHaftar 's forces launched their assault on Thursday, Libya 's unity government said.

Warlord Khalifa Haftar struck Tripoli 's only functioning international airport on Monday, drawing a rebuke from the United Nations. His advance on the capital threatens to spark civil war and convulse oil markets. The battle for control of Tripoli is poised to turn into the bloodiest since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ended Moammar Al Qaddafi 's 40-year rule.

European Parliament President Antonio Tajani has commented on the current situation in Libya. Tajani said that France and Italy have separate interests in Libya and that Sarkozy was one of the strong supporters of overthrowing and then killing Muammar Gaddafi. He warned that if no efforts are taken right now to resolve the Libyan crisis the situation in the country will become unmanageable.

UN chief calls for immediate halt to Libya fighting. Appeal followed an air attack by the forces of commander Khalifa Haftar on the Mitiga airport east of the capital. The air strike shut down Tripoli 's only functioning airport as fighting raged around the capital and thousands fled. Libya has been rocked by violent power struggles between an array of armed groups since the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.



EU leaders grant UK a six-month extension to leave the EU after late-night talks in Brussels. The new deadline - 31 October - averts the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on Friday. The UK must now hold European elections in May, or leave on 1 June without deal. MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year.

Mark Francois was making the comments while he was on BBC Newsnight. Mr Francois waved off claims his European Research Group ( ERG ) had killed off Brexit by refusing to back Prime Minister Theresa May 's deal. On Monday night, royal assent was given to the bill that would rule out a no deal Brexit.

Ministers and their shadow counterparts will continue cross-party talks on Tuesday. Sources indicated the PM had not accepted Labour 's customs union demand. But there was a move towards changing the non-binding political declaration. The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday.

Theresa May will offer to rewrite the government 's withdrawal bill to make sure a customs arrangement is enshrined in law. The move would be hard for a future Eurosceptic PM to retract after she steps down. May will meet EU leaders Wednesday to make her case for a short extension to June 30. European Council President Donald Tusk is pushing for a delay of as long as a year to allow time to forge consensus.

Sterling held above $ 1.3 on Monday but traded in a narrow range reflecting nervousness in the market. Britain is due to leave the European Union on Friday but May is seeking a compromise with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on the terms of the divorce. A compromise would support her request to delay Brexit until the end of June.

Watch the next episode of Europe 's most-viewed soap opera, this Wednesday evening. They have never followed UK politics more closely .

They believed they were in a welcoming country. Three consultants discuss how their lives have been upended. Dr Thomas Peukert from Germany: I feel like I 've become a second-class citizen. Dr Alexia Tsigka from Greece: I thought Britain had a long history of successfully assimilating immigrants.

Theresa May on Monday started a last-minute flurry of European diplomacy that includes visits to Paris and Berlin. May is hoping European leaders will agree on Wednesday to delay Brexit for a second time. The EU agreed last month to postpone it from 29 March to 12 April. May will ask at a special summit on Wednesday for it to be pushed back to 30 June.



Researchers in the Philippines have discovered a species of ancient human previously unknown to science. The small-bodied hominin lived on the island of Luzon at least 50,000 to 67,000 years ago. Homo luzonensis flips the script on the idea that the human line neatly progressed from less advanced to more advanced species.

Three divers who helped rescue a Thai football team last year have made a fresh discovery in Vietnam. They explored a tunnel that could expand the footprint of the world 's largest cave. The team was invited to descend into a waterlogged pit in the Son Doong cave in central Vietnam. The tunnel has never been explored and is believed to connect to nearby chambers.

Three divers who helped rescue a Thai football team last year have made a fresh discovery in Vietnam. They explored a tunnel that could expand the footprint of the world 's largest cave. The team plans to return to Vietnam next year to try to link the tunnel to another cave near Son Doong. Only 30 percent of Vietnam 's Phong Nha national park has so far been explored.

The mysteries of central Vietnam 's Sơn Đoòng cave are being plumbed by three of the divers who helped rescue a football team trapped in a Thai cave last year. The three divers - Chris Jewell, Jason Mallinson and Rick Stanton - are best known for their role in helping to save 12 footballers and their coach who became trapped in Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Thailand in late June 2018. Following their daring efforts , the diving trio were invited to explore the uncharted , waterlogged pit inside the cave. The trio dove down 252 feet ( 77 metres ) into the pit before they were forced to turn back to avoid

The team plans to return to Vietnam next year to try to link the tunnel to another cave near Son Doong. Only 30 per cent of Vietnam 's Phong Nha national park has been explored.

Vietnam 's Hang Son Doong Cave is so big it can fit a 40-story skyscraper within its walls. The 2.5-million-year-old cave, which measures over 5.5 miles in length, might actually be bigger than previously thought. Three U.K. divers, part of the team that helped rescue a Thai football team trapped in a cave last year, explored a subterranean river system.

Bones and teeth of the newly described hominin were found in Callao Cave on Luzon island in the Asian archipelago. Named Homo luzonensis , the species stood at less than four feet tall - information gleaned from the small size of its teeth. Fossils were found to date back to a time period in the late Pleistocene era as recent as 50,000 years ago. It also had primitive looking fingers , and both the fingers and toes were curved - suggesting that the creature liked to climb.

Homo luzonensis is believed to have lived more than 50,000 years ago on Luzon. Discovery marks the second time that a species of early human has been found on islands in Southeast Asia that are separated from both the Asian and Australian continental shelves by deep-water straights. Four of the teeth were from a single individual, allowing the Filipino, French and Australian research team to compare their dimensions to other early humans and to modern Homo sapiens.

Fossils came from a cave on the island of Luzon. Two of the specimens were at least 50,000 years old. East Asia was also occupied by our own species as well as Neanderthals. The creature apparently used stone tools and its small teeth suggest it might have been rather small-bodied.

A small spacecraft that has captured the imagination and excitement of people in Israel and around the world appears to have crashed into the moon. The mood at the command center was somber but still celebratory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel attended the event at the mission 's command center in Yehud, Israel.

The first privately financed spacecraft passed its crucial test on Thursday when it dropped right into lunar orbit week before landing. The lander , dubbed '' Beresheet , '' Hebrew for '' Genesis , '' or '' In the Beginning , '' is among the tiniest spacecrafts ever before to have entered the moon 's orbit. A successful mission would make Israel the fourth largest state to pull a moon landing.

Israel is set to become the fourth country to land a spacecraft on the moon. The Beresheet is expected to land on the lunar surface on April 11. The mission is being coordinated by SpaceIL, a non-profit organization. One of the aims of the mission is to study the moon 's magnetic field.

Israel is on the cusp of becoming the fourth nation to land on the surface of the moon. Beresheet is scheduled to touchdown between 19:00 and 20:00 UTC ( Universal Coordinated Time ) on Thursday. It is fitted with a magnetometer to study the moon 's magnetic field. It will also leave one of NASA 's retroreflectors on the lunar surface for reflecting laser beams from Earth onto the Moon.

Israel's Beresheet mission will attempt a soft landing Thursday. The privately funded SpaceIL spacecraft is currently orbiting our lunar neighbor. SpaceIL could become the first private , nongovernment group to set a lander on the moon 's surface. Israel would then join the US , Soviet Union and China as just the fourth country to successfully land a mission on the Moon.

The first Israeli spacecraft to journey to the moon passed its most crucial test yet on Thursday. The spacecraft finally swung into the moon 's elliptical orbit - keeping it on track for touchdown April 11. The lander is the smallest spacecraft in history to have entered the moon's orbit.

The Beresheet spacecraft is now in its smallest elliptical orbit around the moon. At its closest point , the spacecraft is 15-17 kilometers ( 9-10 miles ) above the moon 's surface. If all goes according to plan, the spacecraft will touch down on the moon's surface on April 11. Dozens of watch parties are planned across Israel, including a party at the President 's Residence.

Israeli spacecraft Beresheet is scheduled to touch down on the moon 's surface on Thursday night. Watch parties and celebrations are planned throughout Israel. A successful landing will make Israel the fourth country - after the Soviet Union, the U.S. and China. The spacecraft will leave a time capsule containing hundreds of digital files.

The lander named Beresheet successfully completed a six-minute engine firing to slow its speed and enter lunar orbit. The critical maneuver set the stage for a touchdown in the Sea of Tranquility around 4 p.m. Eastern time on April 11. The spacecraft sent back images of the moon 's crater-pocked far side with Earth a small , glowing orb in the distance.

Lockheed Martin is unveiling new designs for a human lunar lander concept that can take people to and from the lunar surface. The company says it can be ready within the next five years - as long as it has enough resources. The vehicle consists of two elements : a lander portion that can travel down to the ground and an ascent vehicle that can lift astronauts off the Moon 's surface.

But the extradition case and Assange's possible arrival in the US will be electrified by all those unresolved issues. Assange's role in 2016 cut like a meat cleaver through the administration dividing Trump loyalists on the far right from traditional conservatives who portray him as nothing less than a Kremlin accomplice.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill banning abortions after a detectable heartbeat. The bill outlaws abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as five weeks into pregnancy. The ACLU of Ohio said it was preparing a constitutional challenge to the law on behalf of Pre-Term Cleveland.

North Dakota Republican Governor Doug Burgum signed legislation on Wednesday ( Apr 11) making it a crime for doctors to perform a second-trimester abortion. The move came the same day that Ohio 's Republican-controlled legislature passed one of the nation 's most restrictive abortion bans. Similar laws have been passed in Mississippi and West Virginia.

The bill bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected and allows for the prosecution of doctors who perform them after that point. Doctors would face a fifth degree felony punishable by up to one year in prison for performing an abortion after detecting a heartbeat. The bill does include an exception to save the life of the woman but no exception for rape or incest.

Ohio lawmakers just passed a bill to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. Republican Gov . Mike DeWine has promised to sign the abortion ban, which is one of the nation 's strictest. The legislation is the brainchild of Janet Folger Porter, an anti-abortion activist who rose to national prominence as the spokeswoman of scandal-plagued Alabama Sen. Roy Moore.

Senate Bill 23 would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. Doctors would face a fifth-degree felony punishable by up to a year in prison. Bill has exception to save the life of the woman but no exception for rape or incest. Proponents of abortion access are expected to file a lawsuit.

Ohio lawmakers approve what both sides are labeling the strictest abortion law in the nation. The controversial Heartbeat Bill was approved by the Senate 18-13, shortly after the House passed it 56-39. Gov. Mike DeWine has promised to sign the bill, which would ban abortions, except to save the life of the woman.

The bill cleared its final hurdle Wednesday when the Ohio Senate agreed to House changes 18-13. The Ohio House had approved the measure 56-39 earlier in the day. A fetal heartbeat can be detected as early as five or six weeks into pregnancy. The bill makes no exceptions for rape or incest.

Ohio's closely divided politics have slowed progress of the so-called heartbeat bill. Five other states have now passed similar bans, two of which have been blocked by the courts. Gov. Mike DeWine has said he will sign the bill, after former GOP Gov . John Kasich vetoed it twice.

The bill passed the Ohio House and Senate for the third time. It bans abortion from the point a fetal heartbeat is detected. Gov. Mike DeWine says he 'll sign it into law. Similar bills have passed in several other states but courts have stopped the bans.

A bill banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected is headed to Gov. Mike DeWine. Opponents of the so-called heartbeat bill vow to sue. Goodyear is planning to expand production at one of its European facilities. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will be in Northeast Ohio this weekend.

Government parties took a drubbing in Finland 's parliamentary election on Sunday. Centre Party polled its lowest general election result ever with just 13.8 percent of the vote to lose 13 seats with all votes counted. Hard-right populist Finns Party came second with 39 seats , just one behind the Social Democrats ' 40 . Coalition partner Blue Reform was obliterated with just one percent of vote and no MPs.

The party has announced 408 candidates , which is 20 fewer than its tally of 428 in 2014. The Congress , on the other hand, has fielded candidates for 271 seats. BJP sources said that the party is likely to announce at least 30 more candidates. In that case, the party will be contesting the highest number of Lok Sabha seats.

Warlord also understood to have private support of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Death toll since Haftar 's assault began on Thursday was put at 121 by the UN World Health Organization. More than 13,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting, which has included air raids that have hit schools.

More than 1,000 people gathered in central Tripoli to demand that Khalifa Haftar stop the advance of his Libyan National Army ( LNA ) on the coastal city. A week of battles has killed 75 people - mainly fighters but also 17 civilians - and wounded another 323, according to latest U.N. tallies. The conflict threatens to disrupt oil supplies, increase migration across the Mediterranean to Europe, and allow Islamist militants to exploit the chaos.

The Libyan National Army ( LNA ) force of Khalifa Haftar advanced on the coastal city a week ago. But armed groups loyal to Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj have so far kept them at bay. On Friday, an LNA warplane bombed the camp of a force allied to Serraj in Zuwara.

Neville Teller: Libya has become a hotbed of disparate Islamist groups battling against each other. The one politico-military figure in today 's Libya possibly able to regain mastery of the situation is Khalifa Hafter, leader of the Libyan National Army ( LNA ) He says Haftar appears to have the power and leadership qualities that Libya needs at present time.

General Khalifa Haftar is a former Gathafi loyalist turned CIA-backed enemy. He is now head of the Libyan national army and has appointed himself the sole guarantor of Libya 's revolution. His single-minded pursuit of Islamists without differentiation has alienated many Libyans. Some see him as Libya's next strongman in the mould of neighbouring Egypt 's President Sisi.

Forces loyal to East Libya-based Khalifa Haftar carried out an airstrike in southern Tripoli on Saturday. No information was available about casualties. Libya has remained beset by turmoil since 2011when a bloody NATO-backed uprising led to the ouster and death of strongman Muammar Gaddafi.

Battles continue to rage between the forces of Libya 's internationally recognized Government of National Accord ( GNA ) and former military commander Khalifa Haftar 's forces in the southern suburbs of Tripoli. Heavy shelling and gunfire in the Libyan capital over the past 6 days has wounded 266 people and killed 56 , including an ambulance driver and 2 medical doctors.

Fighters answering to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar battled units that back Tripoli 's unity government on the edge of the capital Friday. Gunfire and blasts rang out and smoke rose as forces backing the fragile UN-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj attempted to block an offensive. Dozens of people have been killed and more than 300 wounded over the last eight days, the World Health Organization said. The United Nations said the fighting had driven 8,000 people from their homes and that displacements from areas affected by the clashes in and around Tripoli continue to surge.

European Union last week urged the eastern Libya National Army to stop its attacks. But the eastern parliament head said they would press an offensive launched a week ago. The latest battle had by Friday killed 75 people, mainly fighters but including 17 civilians. Some 13,625 people have been forced out of their homes.

James and JoAnne Moriarty were working in Libya 's oil industry when NATO 's massive bombardment began. They were subsequently invited by an international NGO to participate in a fact-finding mission. The Moriartys travelled throughout the country for months, observing and documenting events.

Former Massachusetts Gov . Bill Weld announced Monday he is officially entering the race for president. Weld would be the first Republican to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 race. Weld was the vice presidential nominee on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016. He previously served two terms as the governor of Massachusetts in the early 1990s.

The bipartisan Battleground poll is out with some useful data about the 2020 electorate. It confirms the challenge Republicans face defending an unpopular president. Democrats need to pick their candidate wisely and avoid picking someone as divisive or unlikable as Trump. They must turn out their base without turning off those white and married women whom Trump chased off.

President Donald Trump will visit Minnesota on Monday. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton by fewer than 45,000 votes in 2016. The campaign also is targeting New Mexico, Nevada, and New Hampshire. The focus on Minnesota and Trump 's other near-misses come as there is mounting concern within the Democratic Party.

The 2020 election is still a year and a half away, but already the Democratic field of contenders is well over a baker 's dozen. But while Republicans brought 17 candidates to the 2016 presidential primaries , there have n't been many RSVPs to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020. So far, three people have mentioned maybe, possibly, if everything felt right, running against Trump in the Republican Party 's 2020 primary. None of the men have fully or formally tossed their hats into the ring.

President Donald Trump is bullish about his re-election chances in Minnesota despite the state 's long history of backing Democrats for president. Minnesota 's pickup potential was on Trump 's mind even before the 2016 election when he fell just over 44,000 votes short of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Democratic strategists in Minnesota are confident about protecting their streak next year.

Trump 's reelection campaign is set to report that it raised more than $ 30 million in the first quarter of 2019.

 Columbine massacre left 12 students and one teacher dead on April 20, 1999. Many parents fear Columbine still has power to captivate would-be attackers. Students organizing day of service saw preparations eclipsed by emergency text messages. Some parents said they told their children to play close to home on Wednesday.

Denver Post analysis of lockout and lockdown data compiled from the state 's 25 largest school districts shows it 's a rare week when students are shuttered inside a building to protect them from a threat. Data is almost certainly an undercount , because many districts do n't track security incidents , but it does provide a small window into the experiences of Colorado students. In most cases, lockdowns were a response to a perceived threat inside a school. About 10 percent were because someone accidentally hit an alarm.

Scientists Restore Some Function In The Brains Of Dead Pigs. Yale University research team is careful to say that none of the brains regained the kind of organized electrical activity associated with consciousness or awareness. The researchers emphasize that the goal was definitely not to restore consciousness in these pig brains. The approach offers a new way to study brain diseases or injuries in the lab.

Scientists have brought back to life pigs ' brains - four hours after death. Circulation and cellular activity were restored using tubes that pumped a chemical solution replicating blood into the decapitated heads. Billions of neurons began acting normally - but it 's currently unclear if the technique would work on a recently deceased person.

Scientists spur some activity in brains of slaughtered pigs. The brains could not think or sense anything. By medical standards, they 'd been dead for four hours by the time scientists began pumping a special artificial blood through them. Further work might lead to new therapies for stroke and other conditions, as well as a new tool for studying the brain.

Further work might lead to new therapies for stroke and other conditions, as well as a new tool for studying the brain.

US researchers have revealed that the brains of decapitated pigs can be partially revived several hours after the animal has died. Some of the functions of cells booted back up when an oxygen-rich fluid is circulated through the organ. The scientists stress that they do not show any signs of consciousness and that it does not change the definition of death. But they say they have found a way to prevent brain cells sustaining irreparable damage as blood stops circulating.

Scientists spur some activity in brains of slaughtered pigs. The brains could not think or sense anything, researchers stressed. But the work revealed a surprising degree of resilience among cells. Such research might lead to new therapies for stroke and other conditions. Researchers have no current plans to try their technique on human brains.

Researchers have restored some cellular activity to brains removed from slaughtered pigs. The work is very preliminary and has no immediate implications for treatment of brain injuries in humans. But the idea that parts of the brain may be recoverable after death contradicts everything medical science believes about the organ and poses metaphysical riddles.



France 's prime minister has announced an international architecture competition to rebuild the iconic arrow-like spire atop the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The 300-foot spire toppled over in flames on Monday night as a massive fire engulfed the world-famous medieval Catholic cathedral. Firefighters battled the blaze for nine hours before quelling the flames. No one was killed in the fire, the cause of which is under investigation.

Nearly $ 1 billion in donations have poured in for the vast restoration of the fire-ravaged Notre Dame cathedral. But a pledge by French President Emmanuel Macron that it will be completed within five years was facing accusations of being wildly off track. Experts have said the ambitious timeline appears insufficient for such a massive operation. Even French Minister Edouard Philippe acknowledged in an address Wednesday that it would be difficult.

Billionaire François-Henri Pinault said he hoped the money would help to rebuild Notre-Dame. He is the chairman and CEO of the Kering group, which owns such brands as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. The 850-year-old building was undergoing a multi-million Euro restoration project at the time of the fire.

French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris after a colossal fire tore through the building. The inferno destroyed the roof of the 850-year-old UNESCO world heritage landmark , whose spectacular Gothic spire collapsed as orange flames and clouds of grey smoke billowed into the sky. Around 400 firefighters battled into the night to control the flames.

French billionaires the Pinault family have reportedly pledged more than 100 million euros ( £86 million ) to restore the 800-year-old cathedral. France 's Fondation du Patrimoine said it would be starting an international appeal. Mr Macron said he would be looking beyond our borders as the fundraising campaign got under way.

French billionaire François-Henri Pinault has pledged 100 million euros to help rebuild the Notre Dame Cathedral ravaged by a devastating fire Monday. The French billionaire owns the company Kering , which own luxury fashion brands like Gucci and Saint Laurent. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral and says a national fundraising campaign to restore Notre Dame would be launched Tuesday.

French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on the tragic Notre Dame fire earlier tonight and pledged that `` we will rebuild this cathedral . '' He thanked the many firefighters who fought the flames for hours and said , `` In the last hours , thanks to their dedication and the dedication of all the instruments of state ''

A French official and the Paris fire chief say they think Notre Dame Cathedral 's landmark rectangular towers have been saved from the fire. The mayor of Paris says people who live near the cathedral have been evacuated in preparation for the burning structure 's possible collapse. Prosecutors say Paris police will conduct an investigation into involuntary destruction caused by fire.

Cormier says the loss of the Notre Dame Cathedral is a loss of culture that can not be replaced. "It 's sort of like having your heart , your beating heart , pulled out of you," Cormier says. "You just do n't know because anything man makes or woman makes is fragile," he says.

A guest on the Fox News Tucker Carlson show appeared to be saying that the French did not understand the significance of the Notre Dame fire. Mark Steyn, a conservative commentator who sometimes serves as guest host on The Rush Limbaugh Show, appeared on Fox News Monday night. Steyn also claimed that the neighborhood around Notre Dame was a Muslim suburb.

Mueller examined multiple episodes for possible obstruction. Investigators examined about 10 episodes in which the president may have obstructed justice. Mr. Barr said he disagreed with some of the special counsel 's legal theories regarding obstruction but even accepting them found no basis for a criminal charge.

Two versions of special counsel Robert Mueller 's report are planned to be released. The public will get a redacted version of the nearly 400-page report on Thursday. A less-redacted version would go to a limited number of Members of Congress. It 's unclear when lawmakers would be able to view the more transparent report.

Attorney General William Barr has said he is redacting four types of information from the report. Democrats cite precedent from previous investigations in saying they want to see it all. Some Republicans defending Barr are also citing precedent, saying it is appropriate to keep at least some of the information from Congress.

President Donald Trump and the White House are uncertain about what exactly will be revealed in special counsel Robert Mueller 's report. Attorney General William Barr clears its release to the public on Thursday. Sources say the initial response will look much as it did when Mueller first transmitted the report to Barr late last month.

The Justice Department expects to make a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller 's report on the Russia investigation public Thursday morning. The redacted report would be sent to Congress and also made available to the public, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. Trump 's lawyers are putting the finishing touches on a rebuttal to the 400-page document. Rudy Giuliani, one of the president 's attorneys, said it will be published in the hours after the release of the report.

Mr. President: The song has ended but the melody lingers on. The thrust will be the same; even if there is a lack of evidence that you colluded with Russian President Vladimir Putin, you have him to thank for becoming president. We brought the lack of independent forensics to the attention of Attorney General William Barr on March 13 in a Memorandum.

Donald Trump stepped up his attacks Monday in an effort to undermine potential disclosures on Russia, his 2016 campaign and the aftermath. He unleashed a series of tweets focusing on the previously released summary of special counsel Robert Mueller 's conclusions. Democrats are calling for Mueller himself to testify before Congress and have expressed concern that Barr will order unnecessary censoring.

Libya 's oil production has yet to suffer disruptions , even as oil prices have climbed on fears of potential outages. The longer fighting drags on in Tripoli , the more likely it is that there will be an outage.

Islamic State claims responsibility for bomb attacks in Sri Lanka that killed 321 people. Sri Lanka said two domestic Islamist groups with suspected links to foreign militants were suspected to have been behind the attacks. About 500 people were also wounded in the bombings. Three sources told Reuters that Sri Lankan intelligence officials had been warned hours earlier by India that attacks by Islamists were imminent.

The government blamed a Sri Lankan Muslim group for the serial bombings that killed 290 people in the country on and said the attacks were a colossal intelligence failure. The National Thowheed Jamath ( NTJ) carried out the eight explosions across three cities in Sri Lanka , also injuring over 500 people.

Senator Fraser Anning has gone on a furious anti-Muslim rant on Twitter in the wake of the Sri Lankan bombings. Two Australians are dead and another two are injured in the attacks as the death toll rises over 290 with a further 500 injured. Senator Anning wasted little time using the attacks to announce he was `` right all along '' about the connection between Islam and violence. The Queensland senator went on to call out New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern who was pictured donning a hijab out of respect following the Christchurch mosque shootings last month.

Sri Lankan Government received advanced warnings of terror attacks on the country 's Christian churches. Government had been collecting intelligence on members of a Sri Lankan jihadist group after receiving a security memo the week prior that warned of Catholic Church bombings. Government knew as far back as January radical Islamists - possibly tied to the NTJ - had stockpiled weapons and detonators. Within hours of the first round of bombings on Easter Sunday, Sri Lanka security services had found at least 24 suspects.

Sri Lanka attacks: Could the Government have done more to prevent the blasts ? Updated CCTV footage has been released allegedly showing a suicide bomber walking into a church moments before killing Easter Sunday worshippers in Sri Lanka. The string of attacks on churches and hotels in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo killed at least 290 people and wounded nearly 500. Questions are now being raised regarding an alleged warning by the Sri Lanka Foreign Intelligence services prior to the attack. We look into what is in the warning , whether any actions were taken and who was involved.

The Sri Lankan community are in shock following the devastating terrorist attacks across the country that have killed 310 people and injured hundreds more on Sunday. Suicide bombers targeted three churches, three luxury hotels and a guesthouse. The bombers were all linked to National Thowheeth Jama'ath , a local militant radical Islamist group. Forty suspects have been arrested in relation to the attack.

Sri Lanka 's Easter Sunday bomb attacks were retaliation for a recent attack on mosques in New Zealand. Two domestic Islamist groups were believed to be responsible, Sri Lankan official said today. The initial investigation has revealed that this was in retaliation for the New Zealand mosque attack, he said.

Sri Lanka 's deadly Easter Sunday bombings were carried out to avenge the Christchurch mosque shootings. A special session of the Sri Lankan Parliament was convened on Tuesday afternoon. State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said early investigations indicated the bombings could have been retaliation for the terrorist attacks on two mosques in Christchurch.

Sri Lankan state minister says the Easter church bombings were retaliation for New Zealand mosque attacks. The attack took place in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.

Voters in P.E.I. have shed their century-old embrace of the Island 's two-party system. With all polls reporting Tuesday, the Tories had won 12 seats, the Greens held eight, and the Liberals had won six. The Greens had led in opinion polls since August, prompting speculation they could be poised to form Canada 's first Green government.

'My god , I love this island , ' says leader Peter Bevan-Baker after news party will form official opposition. The unprecedented result signifies a major milestone for the environmentally oriented political party. The Progressive Conservatives ( PC ) emerged victorious on Tuesday evening with a thin lead in the province 's legislative seats.

A referendum vote calling for electoral reform was held along with the provincial general election April 23. Unofficial results from Elections P.E.I. showed 51 per cent of voters chose to maintain the status quo. 49 per cent voted for a mixed member proportional ( MMP ) system.

The 66th Prince Edward Island general election will be held this Tuesday. The Green Party of P.E.I. is projected as the favourite to win the popular vote. The Greens are projected to win an average of 15.7 seats, just above the threshold of 14 seats for a majority. The PC seat projection is also wide , and thus uncertain , with anAverage of 6.7 seat per simulation. While the PCs win the most seats in about 10 per cent of simulations , the odds of a PC majority are slim.

The Green party confirms Josh Underhay and his son died in a canoeing accident. The party has suspended all election-related activities for the remainder of the campaign. The Green party has been leading in opinion polls since August. The race remains too close to call when the margin of error in recent surveys is factored in.

Canadians on Prince Edward Island are preparing to vote on Tuesday in a regional election that could lead to a Green party forming a government for the first time in the country 's history. The party leader , Peter Bevan-Baker is a Scotland-born dentist who has transformed a routine election into a closely watched race as he seeks to upend expectation and precedent. The bucolic island - Canada 's smallest province - is best known internationally as the home of LM Montgomery 's classic children 's novel Anne of Green Gables.

Canadians expected to learn late Tuesday whether the cradle of Confederation is going to give birth to the country 's first version of proportional representation. Alongside an election to pick a provincial government, voters will be asked to answer the question. Winning side must receive more than 50% of the votes cast and win a majority of votes in at least 60% of ridings.

Chanel Lewis has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 2016 murder of Karina Vetrano. Lewis, 22, was convicted after five hours of deliberations following his second trial after the first ended in a mistrial. Lewis was arrested in February 2017 after he consented to a DNA swab. His DNA matched what was found on Karina's cellphone, the back of her neck and under her fingernails.

Chanel Lewis was convicted this month in the slaying of Karina Vetrano. A juror says he was improperly pressured to convict Lewis of first-degree murder. Lewis ' defence lawyers have accused the other jurors of misconduct. A hearing about the claims will be held Monday at the New York State Supreme Court in Queens.

Chanel Lewis is due in court today for a hearing on claims of juror misconduct in the case. Lewis was found guilty of strangling and sexually abusing Queens jogger Karina Vetrano. His first trial ended in a hung jury. If the judge denies the defense 's motion today , Lewis will be sentenced Tuesday. He faces up to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Supporters of convicted killer Chanel Lewis are hoping the 22-year-old will be kept out of state prison. His attorneys will present evidence in Supreme Court Monday alleging that juror misconduct lead to a guilty verdict earlier this month. The juror says he felt pressure to convict Lewis of killing and sexually assaulting Queens jogger Karina Vetrano.

A Queens State Supreme Court judge rejected on Monday a request by attorneys for the man convicted of murdering Karina Vetrano to overturn his verdict on jury misconduct allegations. Judge Michael Aloise was unpersuaded during a two-hour hearing by defense claims that there was juror misconduct leading to the April 1 verdict. The ruling clears the way for the sentencing of 22-year-old Lewis on Tuesday.

Chanel Lewis ' lawyers had been seeking to overturn his guilty verdict. They claimed that two jurors talked about the case before deliberations began. One female juror silenced another panelist 's questions about sexual-assault allegations by saying that she was a rape victim. Prosecutors claimed that the juror making the misconduct allegations was seeking his 15 minutes of fame.

FAA Certifies Google 's Wing Drone Delivery Company To Operate As An Airline. The FAA says Wing was able to qualify for an air carrier certificate because it has shown its operations met the FAA 's rigorous safety requirements. With its new air carrier certification in hand, the company says it hopes to expand deliveries in southwest Virginia.

The FAA issued an emergency directive on Thursday after Duluth-based Cirrus reported three incidents on its SF50s. Cirrus notified owners of the seven-seater , single-engine jets late last week of the need to get the planes repaired. The FAA noted that Cirrus and Aerosonic , the Florida company that manufactures the sensor in question , have identified the probable root cause of all three flying incidents.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is set to meet with a panel of multi-nation aviation delegates to assess the re-certification of the Boeing 737 MAX flight control software. This development comes following a test flight of a 737 MAX plane with an updated Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System ( MCAS ) on Tuesday. The assessment will evaluate aspects of the 737 MAX automated flight-control system, including its design and pilot interaction with the system.

Authorities are responding to a plane crash in the prison yard of a facility in Riverside County. Only the pilot was in the Northrop N9M when it crashed, the FAA says. No injuries were reported on the ground, but the aircraft sustained "substantial damage"

The FAA received nearly a dozen whistleblower complaints as recently as 2017. The complaints range from allegations of finding tools and debris inside new planes. Five airlines tell CBS News they have full confidence in the 787 Dreamliner. There 's no evidence a manufacturing issue has lead to a serious safety issue.

Holyoke Community College to offer hands-on program for drone pilots. Flying Drones for Profit, Public Safety and Commercial Applications will meet on four Saturdays. The course will prepare individuals to take the FAA Remote Pilot in Charge exam. The cost for the four-week, non-credit course is $ 315.

Since 2015, the FAA and NASA have been developing something called unmanned aircraft systems traffic management , or UTM. UTM would help drones communicate with other aircraft and secure flight permissions more quickly. It would also make it possible to identify drones in the air, likely via some means of electronic identification readable to people on the ground and linked to the pilot.

Wing is the first drone company to be certified as an air carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration. Company executives said they plan to expand to other parts of Virginia and around the nation. Uber, UPS and other companies are also working on securing related go-aheads from federal officials. Concerns about security and privacy remain.

InSight lander appears to have detected its first seismic event on Mars. The faint rumble was picked up by the probe 's sensors on April 6. It is the first seismic signal detected on the surface of a planetary body other than the Earth and its Moon. The InSight aims to identify multiple quakes to help build a clearer picture of Mars ' interior structure.

Scientists say they might have detected the first known seismic tremor on Mars. The discovery could shed light on the ancient origins of Earth 's neighbour. A dome-shaped probe known as SEIS landed on the surface of Mars in December. The team hopes to be able to gather information about the activity at the centre of Mars.

A dome-shaped probe known as SEIS landed on the surface of Mars in December. The team hopes to be able to gather information about the activity at the centre of Mars.

NASA 's InSight lander gently placed a seismometer on the surface of Mars late in 2018. On April 6 , the effort paid off with the first distinct detection of a marsquake. The quake matches up with data from similar quakes detected by NASA 's Apollo missions on the moon.

Dome-shaped probe known as SEIS landed on the surface of Mars in December after hitching a ride on NASA 's InSight spacecraft. Its instruments measure surface vibrations caused by weather but are also capable of detecting movement from deep within the planet. The team hopes to be able to gather information about the activity at the centre of Mars , hopefully providing insight into its formation billions of years ago.

The first Mars quake has been detected, NASA announced Tuesday. This is the first trembling that appears to have come from inside the planet. The sound was detected by NASA 's Insight Lander , a robot spacecraft that 's now prowling around the Martian surface. The quake is so tiny that it would never be detected on Earth amid the background sounds of waves and wind.

NASA 's InSight lander just detected its first possible quake on the Red Planet. The quake was too small to help scientists learn more about Mars ' structure. But the event proves that Mars is seismically active and that InSights might be able to pick up more quakes in the future.

NASA 's InSight lander has been listening for faint rumbles beneath the surface of Mars since December. On April 6 the lander recorded a seismic signal using its Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure ( SEIS ) instrument. The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion - also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet 's interior.



ISIS claims responsibility for bombings in Sri Lanka. Video shows eight men pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The men are masked, except one who appears to be Mohammed Zaharan. A day earlier, an ISIS-linked chat room had posted photos of masked men it identified as commandos.

A device was found by the country 's air force and was destroyed soon after. The airport has been shut after the discovery was made by officials. The discovery comes on a tragic day for Sri Lankans as more than 200 people were killed in Easter Sunday explosions. Reports suggest the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers.

 DFAT says it has offered consular assistance to one Australian injured in the attacks. At least 207 are confirmed dead following the explosions, which targeted Easter Sunday church services and hotels across Sri Lanka. A police spokesperson said that more than 450 people have been injured. No one has yet said they are behind the attacks, which are the worst violence in the country since Sri Lanka 's bloody civil war ended a decade ago.

Nine bombings of churches, luxury hotels and other sites on Easter Sunday killed more than 200 people. Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena described the blasts as a terrorist attack by religious extremists. Police said 13 suspects were arrested , though there was no immediate claim of responsibility. The explosions - mostly in or around Colombo - collapsed ceilings and blew out windows.

More than two hundred people were killed and hundreds more injured in eight blasts that rocked churches and hotels in and just outside Sri Lanka 's capital on Easter Sunday. Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena described the blasts as a terrorist attack by religious extremists. The explosions - mostly in or around Colombo - collapsed ceilings and blew out windows, killing worshippers and hotel guests.

Sri Lankan authorities blocked most social media after Easter Sunday attacks killed more than 200 people. Officials said the temporary move was meant to curtail the spread of false information and ease tensions. The NetBlocks observatory said it detected an intentional blackout of popular services. The shutdown would extend until the government concludes its investigation into the blasts.

Sri Lankan authorities have blocked most social media services in the country following the Easter Sunday attacks that killed more than 200 people. The NetBlocks observatory said it detected an intentional nationwide blackout of popular services including Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat. Sri Lankan officials said they were temporarily blocking social media to curtail the spread of false information and ease tensions.

Police say coordinated attacks by suicide bombers killed at least 200 and injured more than 400 people in Sri Lanka Sunday morning. Church-goers in Rapid City kept their brothers and sisters across the Pacific in mind during their own Easter celebrations. Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country , but it 's also home to Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities.

The Eiffel Tower went dark to honor the more than 200 people who died in the Sri Lanka bomb attacks. It 's a move the operators of the iconic landmark often make in tribute to causes and calamities. The tower also went dark in May 2017 after an explosion at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester killed 22 people.

An Australian is feared injured in the Sri Lankan terror attacks, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham says. Senator Birmingham condemned the targeted attack of Christians. The eight devastating bomb blasts ripped through high-end hotels and churches holding Easter services in Sri Lanka on Sunday, killing at least 207 people. The apparently coordinated attacks were the deadliest to hit the country in the decade since the end of a bloody civil war that killed up to 100,000 people.

Kansas City CBS affiliate KCTV5 on Thursday revealed that its investigative department was sent what is purported to be a recording of the NFL player and his fiancee. The recording is believed to have been made in early March when the parents were walking through Dubai 's international airport. The audio is 11 minutes long and abruptly cuts off . At no time on the recording does Hill admit to breaking his son 's arm . In fact , he flatly denies it . Parts of the clip have been detailed ( Warning : NSFW language)

Kansas City Chiefs suspend wide receiver Tyreek Hill from all team-related activities. Hill's fiancee accused him of abusing their 3-year-old son. Prosecutors said they believed abuse had occurred in Hill 's home last month. The Chiefs are in the midst of voluntary offseason workouts.

The Chiefs swung a blockbuster trade with the Seattle Seahawks on Tuesday. They acquired pass rusher Frank Clark for a package of picks, a person familiar with the deal says. The two sides then reached an agreement on a $ 105.5 million , five-year contract. The Chiefs have made a habit of inciting controversy during the NFL draft.

The Johnson County ( Kan. ) district attorney 's office announced Wednesday it will not file charges against Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill or his fiancee following an investigation into two March incidents at the couple 's home involving their 3-year-old son. Any new information to emerge could reopen the criminal investigation , with a five-year statute of limitations in Kansas. Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch plans to retire for a second time, according to a report by ESPN 's Adam Schefter.

Police were called to the Kansas City-area home of Hill and Crystal Espinal twice last month. Investigators determined their child had been injured and was placed in protective care. Hill is a two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver with a history of domestic violence issues. The Chiefs or the NFL could still punish Hill and the receiver 's long-term future remains in question.

Authorities in Kansas are unwilling to charge anyone with injuring the three-year-old son of Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill. The NFL has both a challenge and an opportunity under the broad powers of its Personal Conduct Policy. Any evidence generated by the league in connection with its own investigation can then be used by prosecutors.

Voters in Spain are voting in a general election on Sunday, and the country appears at a crossroads. A far-right party is gaining in popularity and traditional politics is fragmenting.

New generation Peugeot 208 is now ready to be ordered on the UK market. Not only the conventional model , but also the electric version of the car. Customers can place a deposit on the GT Line PureTech 100 S & S 8-speed automatic ( EAT8 ) or the 100 % electric e-208 model.

A divided Spain votes Sunday in its third general election in four years. All eyes are on whether a far-right party will enter Parliament for the first time in decades. The fragmentation of the political landscape is the result of austerity that followed a recession. The Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez, is set to win the most votes.



The Socialist Party ( PSOE) won the highest number of seats at the Spanish general election. Some well-known figures are losing their congressional seats. The Socialist Party won an absolute majority in the Senate, breaking 25 years of PP control. The Animalist Party Against Mistreatment of Animals ( PACMA) once again missed out on a seat in Congress.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez 's PSOE party is on course for winning 122 seats in Congress. The Partido Popular, who had made something of a recovery at the last election in 2016 , have experienced a collapse in support. The PP would seem to have suffered from an electorate switch to Ciudadanos and Vox. Vox , a factor for the first time , are set to win 24 seats.

Preliminary results of the third in the last four year in that took place on Sunday showed that the centre-left ( PSOE ) is leading but short of an overall majority. The results also noted that Pedro Sanchez 's would once again seek the support of left-wing Podemos and Catalan pro-independence parties in order to form a government.

NRA president Oliver North and NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre have been at odds for some time. North was conspicuously absent from the NRA 's annual meeting on Saturday. NRA board member Richard Childress read out a letter from North. The statement alleged that the NRA is in the midst of a crisis due to infighting.

The Buffalo Bills picked Ed Oliver ninth overall in the 2019 NFL Draft. Oliver played the hell out of a zero nose in college , but I do n't think anyone believes that 's where he 'll be playing as a professional. The shame of it all is that in the four games I watched Oliver , with all of his impressive physical tools , he was rarely put in position to just fire straight off the ball.

New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday that her office would open an investigation into Facebook 's alleged unauthorized collection of 1.5 million Facebook users ' email contact databases. Facebook claims that the data was directly collected during its verification process for new users. However , the total number of people whose information was improperly obtained may be hundreds of millions.

New York AG opens investigation into Facebook over email contact collection. Last week, Facebook acknowledged that it collected up to 1.5 million users ' email contacts without their consent. The company said that email contact lists had been unintentionally uploaded to Facebook following a design change in 2016 and that it was now in the process of deleting them.

Col. Oliver North is president of the National Rifle Association. He 's taking his passion for telling their stories to NRA TV. Each episode highlights men and women of faith facing risk to help others. North: The Bible is full of heroes to inspire us to be better than what we otherwise might be.

Retired Lt. Col. Oliver North is the president of the National Rifle Association. He says gun-rights activists should not cede power next year to the disarm America movement. He was convicted of three felonies that were later overturned. Mr. North was also a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal during the 1980s.

Wayne LaPierre, the group 's CEO and executive vice president, said he refused the demand. LaPierre called on board members to see this for what it is : a threat meant to intimidate and divide us. North sent his own letter to the board late Thursday evening , in which he said his actions were for the good of the NRA.

Wayne LaPierre, the NRA 's CEO and executive vice president, reportedly sent the letter last night. He claims that NRA President Oliver North is trying to force him out. The fight stems in part from a long-simmering dispute between the NRA and its longtime advertising firm.

Ed Oliver was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the ninth-overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft. The defensive tackle said he was excited to become a member of the Bills. Oliver said he knew plenty about Buffalo because at his alma mater one of his trainers was a fan of the team. But Oliver admitted he was n't wishing teams would n't pick him.

NRA chief Wayne LaPierre asked to resign , New York Times reports. The NRA faces fundraising challenges and a threatened inquiry into its nonprofit status. LaPierre is expected to stay at the NRA until at least the end of the year, when he will be up for re-election.
